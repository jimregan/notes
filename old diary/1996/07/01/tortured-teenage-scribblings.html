</ul><p>Jimmy had been camping at Richard’s house after the Trax, and the next
day Eccentric were auditioning singers (they fired PJ - crap). He said
they taught him a thousand riffs he forgot, and that they’re sound &amp;
said we can use their equipment any time we want. Jimmy tried out as
their singer, but they don’t play “his music”. One guy came in, they
played Die Laughing, he hadn’t a clue so he started doing a death metal
growl: “Eh… it’s Therapy?” “Oh… I thought it sounded punky”.</p>

<p>Sat. we were here, &amp; Paul C came over. Chatted. He’s going to the Gaeltacht by
himself today. Willie &amp; Liam Dunne are going in a few weeks. He’s going
to Feothanach. (Joe went there).</p>
