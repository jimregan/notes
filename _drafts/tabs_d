(1) Christoph Molnar on X: "I just found a great introduction to embedding. The book is comprehensive yet short. Historical encoding tools, neural nets, and production - all covered. Fantastic job by @vboykis. Thanks for making it free to read! Looking forward to diving in. https://t.co/uFwaSjaysn https://t.co/SKl2ExOJaw" / X
