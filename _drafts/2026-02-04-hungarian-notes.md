Got it — we’ll treat this **exactly as a transcription/translation task**, no interpretation beyond what’s on the page.

I’ll keep:

* the **original Hungarian line by line** (even if broken / Whisper-ish),
* a **best-effort literal translation**,
* and then a **small vocabulary list**.
  No smoothing, no fixing unless it’s unavoidable — uncertainty is marked.

---

## Line-by-line translation

**„Nem így emlékeztem”**
→ *“I don’t remember it like this.”*

---

**Miért áltál meg?**
→ *Why did you stop?*
*(likely intended: **Miért álltál meg?**)*

**Gágozzát?**
→ *Are you choking / gagging?* ❓
*(word is unclear / non-standard; possibly **Gágogsz?** “Are you gagging?”)*

**Nem bírok?**
→ *I can’t handle it / I can’t take it?*

---

**Még azokot tudta?**
→ *You even knew about those?* ❓
*(likely **azokat tudtad?**)*

**Azok is ünnek, de nekik nem szállnál.**
→ *They also do it / they’re also into it, but you wouldn’t go after them.* ❓
*(“ünnek” is unclear; possibly **ők is ilyenek** or **ők is jönnek**)*

**Csak állandó velem vagy.**
→ *You’re always only with me.*

---

**Ami a rákot akarsz?**
→ *What the hell do you want?*
*(literally “what cancer do you want?” → idiomatic Hungarian swearing)*

**Hát én megvaszom a szádőtségeit!**
→ *Well then I’ll put up with / swallow your mouth-stupidities!* ❓
*(very garbled; possibly **megveszem a szarságaidat** “I’ll buy your bullshit” or **megszoktam a szarságaidat** “I’ve gotten used to your bullshit”)*

---

## Vocabulary (useful pieces)

* **emlékezni** – to remember
* **állni / megállni** – to stand / to stop
* **bírni** – to endure, to handle
* **állandóan** – constantly
* **csak** – only / just
* **akarni** – to want
* **mi a rákot…** – what the hell… (strong, vulgar)

### Important note (linguistic, not commentary)

This reads like **angry spoken Hungarian**, possibly:

* badly auto-transcribed,
* emotionally charged,
* with slang + swearing + clipped grammar.

If you want, next we can:

* 🔧 **reconstruct a clean Hungarian version** (marked as reconstruction), or
* 🎧 **diagnose Whisper errors line by line**, or
* 🇬🇧 **give a natural English equivalent** that captures tone rather than words.

Just say which.
