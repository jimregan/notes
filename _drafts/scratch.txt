\section{Introduction}

Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are typically built to use phones rather than raw text. Even for languages with shallow orthographies, the relationship between written and spoken forms is often indirect, so phones act as an intermediary to ensure the correct sounds are produced.

Pronunciation dictionaries are difficult to obtain and can never be complete for a living language. For this reason, the task of grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion exists: to automate the production of phonetic representations for words not found in a dictionary.

G2P conversion is typically considered in terms of a single language, but languages do not exist in isolation: words—especially proper names—from other languages make frequent appearances.

While monolingual G2P systems perform well within their target language, they struggle to adapt to words borrowed from others. Unassimilated loanwords follow the phonological rules of their source language, and may even negatively affect the target language model if too many are introduced during training, by increasing ambiguity. For instance, even state-of-the-art end-to-end TTS systems such as DiTTo-TTS \cite{lee2025dittotts} occasionally mispronounce words from well-resourced languages like Polish, despite training on large multilingual datasets.

A further complication arises from how text is marked up for synthesis. Standards such as the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) \cite{w3c:ssml11} permit the explicit specification of language on multiple levels—paragraph, sentence, or word—but these annotations are only useful if the G2P component can interpret them correctly.

In this work, we explore the extent to which multilingual or mixed-language G2P training improves—or degrades—performance across languages. Using the Braxen lexicon \cite{tannander-edlund-2025-braxen}, a Swedish TTS resource containing extensive foreign-language entries, we compare monolingual, multilingual, and untagged models to quantify how cross-language exposure affects phoneme error rate (PER). Our goal is to better understand how multilingual data and language tagging influence pronunciation accuracy in practical TTS systems.

\section{Background}

Recent work in text to speech (TTS), such as \citet{gao2023e3tts}, has moved towards ``end-to-end'' synthesis, 
omitting explicit phonetic transcription. While these models produce highly natural speech, they do not always 
pronounce words correctly. On the DiTTo-TTS samples page\footnote{\url{https://ditto-tts.github.io/}} \cite{lee2025dittotts}, 
for example, the Polish word ``niektórzy'' is mispronounced, even though Polish has a shallow orthography and abundant 
training data.

Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) \cite{w3c:ssml11}, the most widely used standard for instructing a TTS engine 
how text should be read, allows language specification at multiple levels—including paragraph, sentence, token, and word. 
This degree of control is particularly valuable in contexts where the end users rely on spoken forms, such as individuals 
with print disabilities.

A common strategy for handling words of foreign origin is to perform a phoneset mapping, where the output of a G2P 
system for one language is mapped to the phoneset of another. This approach requires separate G2P components for each 
language, as well as explicit mapping rules, which increases the complexity of the text-processing pipeline.

\subsection{Data}

\subsubsection{Braxen}

Braxen is an offshoot of the internal TTS lexicon maintained by the Swedish Agency for Accessible Media (MTM), whose mission includes producing accessible audio materials for individuals with print difficulties. This involves creating audiobooks and TTS services for news, so the lexicon is continuously updated with new vocabulary.

As such, some of the vocabulary in Braxen reflects the realities of text ``in the wild'': it includes a large selection of words from other languages. The most relevant feature for our purposes is that it includes language tags for these foreign words.

As MTM is primarily concerned with the practical matter of producing spoken forms of written material, rather than lexicography per se, a number of inconsistencies appear in the language tagging. Languages are tagged using three-letter ISO codes; in the case of Latin (`lat`), this is a single character away from the codes for Latvian (`lav`) and Lithuanian (`lit`), resulting in a few tagging errors.

By far the most represented foreign language in Braxen is English. English is a mandatory subject in Swedish schools \cite{norrby2014english}; according to the 2024 Eurobarometer report, 90\% of Swedes report feeling comfortably conversational in English \cite{eurobarometer2024languages}, and according to the EF English Proficiency Index 2024, Sweden ranks fourth worldwide \cite{efepi2024}.

In addition to English, Danish and Norwegian are also frequent in Braxen. The three Scandinavian languages form a dialect continuum with substantial mutual intelligibility, and many words are borrowed or shared. However, as is typical of real-world text, many of these words are adapted to Swedish orthography: the Norwegian and Danish letters `æ` and `ø` correspond to Swedish `ä` and `ö`, respectively, with `æ` sometimes rewritten as `ae`.
