[{"Start":0,"End":1.85,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Thank you."},
{"Start":1.85,"End":3.41,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Hello, Anya."},
{"Start":3.41,"End":4.62,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Hello."},
{"Start":4.62,"End":7.54,"Speaker":1,"Content":"You're, you're like floating in the room."},
{"Start":7.62,"End":9.48,"Speaker":0,"Content":"I'm floating."},
{"Start":9.48,"End":10.96,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Your shoes are. Yeah, I'm sorry."},
{"Start":10.96,"End":12.26,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Oopsie."},
{"Start":12.26,"End":26.01,"Speaker":1,"Content":"That's great. Oh, that's magic. You're going through the floor. So, it's cool. Okay, so we're gonna, we're gonna change this room. Is it, am I supposed to start now?"},
{"Start":26.01,"End":27.38,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Uh-huh, that's what's there."},
{"Start":27.62,"End":28.62,"Speaker":1,"Content":"And."},
{"Start":28.62,"End":29.91,"Speaker":0,"Content":"What do you want to change?"},
{"Start":29.91,"End":44.2,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Well, I think, I think it feels a little bit, I, I, we have this open fire here. Maybe we could put the couch facing that open fire, and then we could have TV above the fire."},
{"Start":44.2,"End":45.65,"Speaker":1,"Content":"What do you think about that?"},
{"Start":45.65,"End":49.01,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Isn't it distracting, TV and fire in the same place?"},
{"Start":49.01,"End":52.72,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, maybe, maybe. But we can, we can always, uh, try."},
{"Start":52.72,"End":58.22,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Yeah, we can try, but we can't really move anything right now, so we can discuss something."},
{"Start":58.22,"End":70.71,"Speaker":1,"Content":"But we can discuss, because then, then we could put this, uh, couch, the, the couch, like, phasing there, and then we can put this, uh, armchair here."},
{"Start":70.71,"End":71.46,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Mm-hmm."},
{"Start":71.46,"End":79.38,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Okay, and then the table, like, just, uh, like, twist it around a little bit, so we can, like."},
{"Start":79.38,"End":80.7,"Speaker":0,"Content":"So it's a coffee table."},
{"Start":80.7,"End":90.48,"Speaker":1,"Content":"The coffee table, yeah, exactly. And then the TV goes there. And the mirror, I would like to have right here, because this is not a door. You can have it here, okay?"},
{"Start":90.48,"End":91.51,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Okay."},
{"Start":91.51,"End":93.03,"Speaker":1,"Content":"And, uh."},
{"Start":93.03,"End":94.86,"Speaker":0,"Content":"What about that painting?"},
{"Start":95.02,"End":102.76,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Painting, yeah, it's very nice painting, but, uh, it could go right where the TV is right now, okay?"},
{"Start":102.76,"End":104.76,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Uh-huh, okay."},
{"Start":104.76,"End":113.38,"Speaker":1,"Content":"So, and then, then, uh, maybe, uh, that little. Uh, side table there with a sculpture."},
{"Start":113.38,"End":113.96,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Mm-hmm."},
{"Start":113.96,"End":117.2,"Speaker":1,"Content":"I think that would be very nice there in the window, don't you think?"},
{"Start":117.2,"End":120.67,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Yeah, it would be nice. Do you want to keep the sculpture on it?"},
{"Start":120.67,"End":128.48,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yes, I'm thinking, you know, the light comes in there from the windows. Could be very artistic."},
{"Start":128.52,"End":133.0,"Speaker":0,"Content":"But we have two of them, don't we? There is another small table with a plant."},
{"Start":133.0,"End":139.18,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, you could have that in the other window then with the glass, uh, bowls. What do you say?"},
{"Start":139.65,"End":144.42,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Maybe, but what kind of plant it is? What if it doesn't like too much sunlight? We don't know."},
{"Start":144.42,"End":157.7,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, but the plant can go there where the glass bowl is, and the watering can there fits with the flowers there. But the, the recycle bin, I don't think that's very nice there in the corner. Do you think so?"},
{"Start":157.7,"End":159.38,"Speaker":0,"Content":"No, it's not very nice."},
{"Start":159.38,"End":163.23,"Speaker":1,"Content":"No, I think we should put it on the middle of the coffee table instead."},
{"Start":164.17,"End":166.94,"Speaker":0,"Content":"So everyone remembers to recycle."},
{"Start":166.94,"End":173.58,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Exactly, exactly. Because there's something lying there on the table. Maybe we could recycle that directly. Your watch."},
{"Start":174.48,"End":175.55,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Okay."},
{"Start":175.55,"End":179.81,"Speaker":1,"Content":"And that, why are you, you know, you're not cleaning up after you. What's that?"},
{"Start":179.81,"End":180.98,"Speaker":0,"Content":"What is that?"},
{"Start":180.98,"End":182.25,"Speaker":1,"Content":"You have a box there."},
{"Start":182.25,"End":183.23,"Speaker":0,"Content":"A box?"},
{"Start":183.23,"End":186.56,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah. It should go in the recycle bin now."},
{"Start":186.56,"End":188.12,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Okay, of course, yeah."},
{"Start":188.12,"End":190.82,"Speaker":1,"Content":"You can't just leave boxes around like that, Anya."},
{"Start":191.3,"End":195.28,"Speaker":0,"Content":"I totally agree. We should move it into the recycling bin, yeah."},
{"Start":195.28,"End":198.85,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, so, please. Can you do that now?"},
{"Start":198.85,"End":202.31,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Yeah, of course. No, I can't. I'm sure it's just in the other room."},
{"Start":202.31,"End":204.76,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Oh, I'm standing in, in the couch."},
{"Start":205.04,"End":208.07,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Oops. What about that lamp?"},
{"Start":208.07,"End":220.62,"Speaker":1,"Content":"The, the lamp, yeah, this lamp, it's, uh, it's very big. Maybe that could go in the corner there by the, the, where the recycle bin is now."},
{"Start":220.62,"End":224.65,"Speaker":0,"Content":"But isn't it for reading? Like, sitting on the couch and reading with the lamp?"},
{"Start":224.65,"End":239.01,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, that's a good idea. Then, then we could, we could, uh, take the, the, maybe, uh, we have the armchair a little closer to the corner there instead of here, as I said before. What do you think about that?"},
{"Start":239.01,"End":240.88,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Where again? I didn't get it."},
{"Start":240.88,"End":251.54,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Well, if you say we have the couch, uh, going over like that, facing the TV and the fireplace, and then we have the,"},
{"Start":251.81,"End":256.97,"Speaker":1,"Content":"the armchair, like, a little bit towards the corner there where the light is."},
{"Start":256.97,"End":257.86,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Mm."},
{"Start":257.86,"End":258.95,"Speaker":1,"Content":"What do you say?"},
{"Start":258.95,"End":260.95,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Yeah, I think it's a good idea."},
{"Start":260.95,"End":267.65,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, I think it's gonna be nice with the TV there. Maybe a little bit strange, but, but still nice."},
{"Start":267.75,"End":272.32,"Speaker":0,"Content":"And what about that, uh, cabinet that is under the painting right now?"},
{"Start":272.32,"End":280.93,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, it's a tricky one. Maybe. Maybe on top of the fireplace in front of the TV."},
{"Start":280.93,"End":282.41,"Speaker":0,"Content":"On top of the fireplace?"},
{"Start":282.41,"End":282.92,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah."},
{"Start":282.92,"End":287.53,"Speaker":0,"Content":"I don't think it will fit there. Do you think it's? No, I don't think it will fit."},
{"Start":287.53,"End":294.44,"Speaker":1,"Content":"You think it will be hard to, to watch TV with the, oh, my finger is falling apart."},
{"Start":295.48,"End":302.38,"Speaker":1,"Content":"I'm losing my thumb. I can't hitchhike. Okay."},
{"Start":303.1,"End":304.0,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Okay."}]
