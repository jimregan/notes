The Easter Holidays

The first few days of the Easter

Holidays were quite uneventful.

I sat around all dy watching

TV Then on Holy Thursday

I had to pack messages at

Crazy Prices. This was quite

boring too. I had to do iot again on

Easter Saturday. At lunch time we

were eating at the Apollo. I had

finished. One of the lads asked my Patrol

leader to pass the vinegar. As he was

doing this he knocked the leaders coffee

on top of me. That evening after

I found out we had no scouts I

went into Romcos and played my first

ever game of Streetfighter 2. The next

day we went on a parade to mass.

The next Sunday we went

climbing Galteamore. I almost died

of tiredness on the way up and from

the idiots from other units on the way

down. But when we got to the

bottom we stopped for a rest

and we played on a heather-cover-

ed hill. Then we went to our buses.

When I got home I found that I had

missed both episodes of "The Simpsons"

and after a while I watched Mr Bean.

Then after a couple of hours I went to

sleep, dreading school the next

day.
