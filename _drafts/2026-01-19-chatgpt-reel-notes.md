Milyen jármű a trojka?
Három lovas orosz faszán

### Line-by-line translation

**Milyen jármű a trojka?**
What kind of vehicle is a *troika*?

**Három lovas orosz faszán.**
A Russian one with three horses — *up his ass*.
*(Vulgar punchline; the obscenity is the joke.)*

---

### Humour & why it works

This is a **two-line pub joke / schoolyard riddle** built on:

* **Legitimate quiz setup**
  *trojka* = a real Russian three-horse carriage.
* **Expectation of a factual answer**
* **Sudden obscene derailment**
  The second line grafts a crude insult onto an otherwise correct description.

The laugh comes from:

* **register collision** (encyclopaedic → vulgar)
* **phonetic snap** (the obscene noun lands hard at the end)
* **national stereotype bait** (old-school, intentionally dumb)

It’s not clever-wordplay humour; it’s **blunt shock timing**.

### Linguistically interesting bits

* **milyen jármű** – “what kind of vehicle”; textbook question frame.
* **trojka** – loanword; culturally specific, instantly recognisable.
* **három lovas** – “three-horse”; correct modifier phrase.
* **orosz** – “Russian”; neutral adjective until the punch.
* **faszán** – vulgar adverbial form built from *fasz*; here used as an insult, not a manner adverb.

---

### Register & genre

* **Low-register riddle joke**
* Typical of:

  * locker-room humour
  * late-night TV banter
  * deliberately unsophisticated delivery
* Works best **spoken**, with a pause before the last word.

---

### Why this is useful background input

* Trains you to recognise **Hungarian joke cadence** where:

  * the setup is clean,
  * the payload is carried by the *final stressed word*.
* Shows how Hungarian tolerates **sudden obscene suffixation** without syntactic scaffolding.

If you want, next we can:

* compare this to **Polish / English equivalents** structurally, or
* rewrite it in **non-vulgar Hungarian** to show why it collapses, or
* just keep going with the next reel/text.
