Milyen jármű a trojka?
Három lovas orosz faszán

### Line-by-line translation

**Milyen jármű a trojka?**
What kind of vehicle is a *troika*?

**Három lovas orosz faszán.**
A Russian one with three horses — *up his ass*.
*(Vulgar punchline; the obscenity is the joke.)*

---

### Humour & why it works

This is a **two-line pub joke / schoolyard riddle** built on:

* **Legitimate quiz setup**
  *trojka* = a real Russian three-horse carriage.
* **Expectation of a factual answer**
* **Sudden obscene derailment**
  The second line grafts a crude insult onto an otherwise correct description.

The laugh comes from:

* **register collision** (encyclopaedic → vulgar)
* **phonetic snap** (the obscene noun lands hard at the end)
* **national stereotype bait** (old-school, intentionally dumb)

It’s not clever-wordplay humour; it’s **blunt shock timing**.

---

### Linguistically interesting bits

* **milyen jármű** – “what kind of vehicle”; textbook question frame.
* **trojka** – loanword; culturally specific, instantly recognisable.
* **három lovas** – “three-horse”; correct modifier phrase.
* **orosz** – “Russian”; neutral adjective until the punch.
* **faszán** – vulgar adverbial form built from *fasz*; here used as an insult, not a manner adverb.

---

### Register & genre

* **Low-register riddle joke**
* Typical of:

  * locker-room humour
  * late-night TV banter
  * deliberately unsophisticated delivery
* Works best **spoken**, with a pause before the last word.

---

### Why this is useful background input

* Trains you to recognise **Hungarian joke cadence** where:

  * the setup is clean,
  * the payload is carried by the *final stressed word*.
* Shows how Hungarian tolerates **sudden obscene suffixation** without syntactic scaffolding.

If you want, next we can:

* compare this to **Polish / English equivalents** structurally, or
* rewrite it in **non-vulgar Hungarian** to show why it collapses, or
* just keep going with the next reel/text.

> I've seen two video clips showing this on the Hungarian version of who wants to be a millionaire

Yep — that tracks, and it’s not accidental.

On the Hungarian **Legyen Ön is milliomos!**, this joke works **especially well on air** for a few reasons:

### Why *this* joke survives prime-time TV

1. **Quiz-compatible setup**
   *„Milyen jármű a trojka?”* is a **perfectly legitimate trivia question**.
   The host can deliver it dead straight, which buys the joke credibility.

2. **Last-word payload**
   Hungarian allows the obscene punch to sit **entirely on the final stressed word** (*faszán*).
   That means:

   * the joke is already “complete” before the obscenity
   * the obscenity feels like a tag, not the core content

3. **Censorship-friendly structure**
   On TV they can:

   * bleep or cut the last word
   * let the audience reaction do the rest
     The joke still lands because the **audience has already parsed the sentence**.

4. **Old, recognisable joke stock**
   This is important culturally:
   it’s a **well-known, lowbrow riddle**, not a fresh insult.
   That makes it feel:

   * nostalgic
   * unserious
   * “everyone knows this one”
     → much safer for broadcast.

5. **Hungarian tolerance for blunt vulgarity (in jokes)**
   Hungarian TV is relatively permissive with:

   * single-word obscenities
   * especially if they’re:

     * not sexual *actions*
     * not directed at a present individual
     * framed as humour, not aggression

### Why it shows up in *two* clips

Shows like *Legyen Ön is milliomos!* recycle moments where:

* the **host almost breaks**
* the **contestant surprises with a dirty-but-structurally-clean answer**
* the **studio laughs before the bleep**

Those clips circulate because:

* the joke is instantly intelligible
* it’s short
* it needs zero context
* censorship itself becomes part of the humour

So your observation is spot-on:
this joke isn’t just compatible with Hungarian TV — it’s *optimized* for it.

If you want, we can:

* list other **Hungarian “last-word obscene” jokes** that work the same way, or
* compare how the *same* joke would fail on British or Irish quiz TV, or
* look at how **bleep timing** affects Hungarian joke perception.

Up to you.
