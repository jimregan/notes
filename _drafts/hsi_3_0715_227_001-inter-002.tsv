0.0	2.8000000000000003	thank you for showing me or something like that and that's the end
5.5200000000000005	11.76	because i am i am seeing her so maybe she can say like just wrap it up yeah
23.44	27.04	so hey how are you i'm here i mean everything is gorgeous here
30.56	42.72	i'm good i'm good
49.760000000000005	52.72	oh yeah i mean it looks really comfortable where do you get it
60.0	62.4	and try out coaches oh i see
65.12	70.8	wow that's great because it's it seems really good quality so if you bought it even half price it
70.8	76.72	it must it must be a really good deal i mean and i also really like the color
81.2	84.0	it's really flexible i think yeah
86.16	88.0	you know it's not too hard it's not too
90.32	98.88	and also sometimes you know with the cultures it's too deep yeah this one is cool you know i
98.88	106.4	don't even need this pillows you know wow okay yeah that's great i think though you could add
106.4	112.4	a blanket because that would be really nice like for watching tv or this kind of things
112.4	115.76	of course yeah have a little store nearby
120.0	125.44	but it's a little bit low though so to get up somewhere oh i see yeah
129.36	132.32	i see you have a really nice view like in the balcony
137.92000000000002	140.88	you're really close to nature that's that's really cool
142.48	145.2	you can make a picnic or something that would be great
150.0	152.0	yeah
152.4	153.92	i mean
153.92	157.04	not the opposite but in cold weather
157.6	162.0	oh i thought you were preparing it here and then taking it out yeah that might be really
162.72	164.0	comfortable
174.0	179.68	but it's really functional i think because you can put some drinks and something to eat if you invite
179.68	184.78	some friends over the net then you can just invite them with something to eat
184.78	189.84	or drink like a movie night something like this
194.04000000000002	204.34	yeah but did you get any kind of advice from the creation or a designer or this
204.34	226.2	kind of things yeah sizes colors textures it's not that you see
233.34	234.2	that's great
234.2	234.32	I think
234.34	239.26	at night it would give a really cozy environment when you just turn it on
253.48000000000002	264.2	oh I see but I mean it's really nice and what about the decorations I mean I think everything is great here
264.2	275.12	yeah it took me so much time to decide it took me like one year before I decided for each outfit it should be important
275.12	277.21999999999997	yeah of course it makes the overall thing
277.21999999999997	284.26	yeah for example this lady I was on a I traveled to Gambia
284.26	285.32	uh-huh
285.32	290.74	and yeah I was in the shop like a member
290.74	294.06	and the guy there said
294.06	308.36	of course
308.36	318.56	uh-huh

318.96	323.92	yeah
323.92	333.64000000000004	I think it has a whole vibe in itself I I know also the story behind it it's really cool
333.64000000000004	339.82	yeah yeah it is it's not it's not only about the object but the story behind it I think that that's great
339.82	341.18	yeah you remember
