Philipp Schmid on X: "Is it possible to teach LLMs a different language? ðŸ¤” Can we transfer the capabilities of LLMs, like Llama, from English to non-English language? A group of researchers from Fudan University tried to answer those questions by running vast experiments on extending vocabularyâ€¦ https://t.co/fJLYFyQOqP" / X
