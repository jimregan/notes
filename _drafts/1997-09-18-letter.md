[Dear M,]{.span0}

[ I\'ve been a good boy. I\'ve just finished typing out all the notes I
got today so if (when) I lose them/damage them I won\'t be completely
shagged (even though it\'s stuff I know). It\'s a good habit to get
into. Gordon showed me the handout he got in art history. Has a cool
doodle along the side, and on the top corner \'Jesus if you\'re out
there, please save me\' and \'Jesus I need vodka\'. OK, so not much is
happening, cept I couldn\'t get thru to Gerry yesterday, he wasn\'t
there today, and I phoned dad at lunch to ask him if he knew, he said
he\'d phone, it\'s roughly 9.30 and (OK, you\'re just after phoning) no
call. So, I\'ll probably see you tomorrow. Bye.I love you loads and
loads and loads, and I miss you loads, and I am starting to feel OK
about being here (though it\'s mainly cos I\'m going back tomorrow).
Bye.]{.span0}
