you wear your hope as second hand clothes · you can't bring back your
lost innocence by buying idiocy · everything neon and clouded grey · I
can see her everywhere, and it's killing me · lost it all but innocence
and now that's gone · the only promise I can keep is to forget it all ·
It's statutory pain, and must be shown · I've won this so easy that I
feel I've lost · I'm not leaving here missing things · You know me like
no-one knows, more inside-out than head to toe · I've often pretended I
knew what to be, but now I know what to know · In your hypocrisy, little
greed, you pray for what you need · Day after day, they all accept, I am
to blame · Even when you'd lie, I'd let you let me down, don't you know
it's always my fault? · And while you grow and build your world, don't
lose the fun of it all · your smile turns my stomach to a hole · have
fun deciding why **y**ou want to leave me alone · To you, your mirror
means escape
