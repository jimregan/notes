    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* TTS systems often fail to correctly pronounce proper names.\n",
    "* Common G2P rules don‚Äôt cover idiosyncratic or culturally variable names.\n",
    "* We release a dataset of names with **quasi-phonetic** transcriptions to support pronunciation-aware modeling.\n",
    "* We demonstrate a minimal use case: **retrieving phoneme-like transcriptions** to improve pronunciation during synthesis.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Related Work**\n",
    "\n",
    "* G2P and pronunciation dictionaries.\n",
    "* Quasi-phonetic transcriptions (e.g., in dictionaries, media guides).\n",
    "* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in NLP and speech.\n",
    "* Name pronunciation in TTS and public communication systems.\n",

    "  1. **Detect named entities** in input text (e.g., using spaCy)\n",

    "  4. **Inject into phonetized input** of TTS system (e.g., a phoneme-based model)\n",
    "* Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Minimal wrapper over a TTS system (like ESPnet or Festival)\n",
    "  * Simple edit-distance retrieval or embedding similarity\n",

    "* A curated dataset of name pronunciations in human-readable quasi-phonetic form.\n",
    "* A minimal, effective RAG-based system for improving TTS name pronunciation.\n",
