{"Start":29.78,"End":45.69,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Well, I think, I think it feels a little bit, I, I, we have this open fire here. Maybe we could put the, the couch facing that open fire, and then we could have the TV above the fire. What do you think about that?"},

{"Start":80.62,"End":90.43,"Speaker":1,"Content":"The coffee table, yeah, exactly. And then the TV goes there. And the mirror, I would like to have right here, because this is not a door. We could have it here, okay?"},

{"Start":91.59,"End":93.65,"Speaker":1,"Content":"And, uh, then I'm thinking."},

{"Start":104.7,"End":117.16,"Speaker":1,"Content":"So, and then, then, uh, maybe, uh, that little, uh, side table there with a sculpture. I think that would be very nice there in the window, don't you think?"},

{"Start":132.53,"End":139.18,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, we could have that in the other window then, with the glass, uh, bowls. What do you say?"},
{"Start":139.66,"End":144.41,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Maybe, but what kind of plant it is? What if it doesn't like too much sunlight? I don't know."},
{"Start":144.41,"End":157.65,"Speaker":1,"Content":"The plant, yeah, but the plant can go there where the glass bowls is then. And the watering can there fits with the flowers. But the, the recycle bin, I don't think that's very nice there in the corner. Do you think so?"},

{"Start":159.27,"End":164.75,"Speaker":1,"Content":"No, I think we should put it on the middle of the coffee table instead. Yeah?"},
{"Start":164.75,"End":166.87,"Speaker":0,"Content":"So everyone remembers to recycle."},
{"Start":166.87,"End":179.78,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Exactly, exactly. Because there's something lying there on the table. Maybe we could recycle that directly. Your watch and that. And that, why are you, you know, you're not cleaning up after you. What's that?"},
{"Start":179.78,"End":180.98,"Speaker":0,"Content":"What is that?"},
{"Start":180.98,"End":182.22,"Speaker":1,"Content":"In the box there."},
{"Start":182.22,"End":183.18,"Speaker":0,"Content":"The box?"},
{"Start":183.18,"End":186.53,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah. It should go in the recycle bin now."},
{"Start":186.53,"End":187.89,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Okay, of course."},
{"Start":187.89,"End":190.78,"Speaker":1,"Content":"You can't just leave boxes around like that, Anya."},

{"Start":207.92,"End":220.58,"Speaker":1,"Content":"The, the lamp, yeah, this lamp, it's, um, it's very big. Maybe that could go in the corner there by the, where the recycle bin is now."},
{"Start":220.58,"End":224.22,"Speaker":0,"Content":"But isn't it for reading? Like sitting on the couch and reading?"},
{"Start":224.22,"End":238.95,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, that's a good idea. Then, then we could, we could, uh, take the, maybe, uh, we have the armchair a little closer to the corner there instead of here, as I said before. What do you think about that?"},
{"Start":238.95,"End":240.83,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Where again? I didn't get it."},
{"Start":240.83,"End":256.95,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Well, if you say we have the couch, uh, going over like that, facing the TV and the fireplace, and then we have the, the armchair, like, a little bit towards the corner there where the light is."},
{"Start":256.95,"End":257.83,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Mmm."},
{"Start":257.83,"End":258.96,"Speaker":1,"Content":"What do you say?"},

{"Start":260.91,"End":267.62,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, I think it's going to be nice with the TV there. Maybe a little bit strange, but, but still nice."},
{"Start":267.86,"End":272.24,"Speaker":0,"Content":"What about that, uh, cabinet that is under the painting right now?"},
{"Start":272.24,"End":280.9,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah, it's a tricky one. Maybe, maybe on top of the fireplace in front of the TV."},
{"Start":280.9,"End":282.49,"Speaker":0,"Content":"On top of the fireplace?"},
{"Start":282.49,"End":283.25,"Speaker":1,"Content":"Yeah."},
