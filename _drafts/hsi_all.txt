data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_120289_124723.wav|1|But it's a little bit low though, so to get up sometimes when you're sleepy is a little bit hard.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_132887_138116.wav|1|Yeah, yeah, it's cool because there's trees, there there's a little park here outside.

data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_218128_223385.wav|1|Because it's hard, you know, online it's pretty hard to be sure what you buy or wha how it looks like.

data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_232558_234626.wav|1|It's really special, you know. It's not
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_240985_247366.wav|1|The green is... it's really, it feels like hot and yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_248183_253975.wav|1|And eh it's a lil bit sleepy, I get a little bit sleepy but with the green so I put it on in the night.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_266262_269439.wav|1|Yeah, it took so much time to decide.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_269961_273799.wav|1|It took me like one year before I decide for each object.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_275971_279032.wav|1|Yeah, for... Yeah, for example, this lady.

data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_308188_315482.wav|1|But uh yeah, but it it seemed like then he he showed me these things that he had.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_317074_329116.wav|1|hidden behind because it was a re... valuable object and uh yeah I really love her she's she's amazing the color the yeah I don't know

data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_348076_351957.wav|1|Then your objects, they also have a certain like smell.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_352217_355864.wav|1|But it's not how they smell now, but if uh like you look at it and you
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_356161_360693.wav|1|You feel the smell from the place you were in. You know what I mean?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_368847_380126.wav|1|And I have another I have several like a bit similar objects you know I like the statues and and dogs dog statues

data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_410951_419711.wav|1|And it was a a story about this, yeah, it's a whole story about this man who was famous like in the 16th century.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_421360_432449.wav|1|Yeah, and like he he did some really amazing things for the populations in the small town I work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_432757_436698.wav|1|So uh yeah, they have lots of stories about him.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_438030_445175.wav|1|Because I think I really think about all these uh stories about him with his hat.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_001_main_508132_512657.wav|1|And where did i buy it? I'm I'm not sure... I think it was here.

data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_324186_334135.wav|1|Ah, yeah, but he sells some, because yeah, it's beautiful, but it's not his main, main job, you know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_341097_351106.wav|1|A little bit, you know, because I, I also travel so I, I, I got some of my, you know, these statues from my, my own travels.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_351687_359073.wav|1|Because yeah, he, I got really interested in traveling because I went with him when I was small also a couple of times.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_376685_383870.wav|1|Those two women, ehh, they are from two different ehh, parts of the world.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_384811_395280.wav|1|The black one, she's from, eh, the eh, Tromsø in the south of Norway, really, really high up in the north.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_396062_401265.wav|1|And eh, we went there together once with a, camping car.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_403724_406012.wav|1|And we found that in a little village.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_408467_412417.wav|1|She's standing like, I don't know, something noble with her.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_412788_415949.wav|1|Something, yeah, I don't know how to say it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_416089_418850.wav|1|Something fragile, but still strong.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_419950_430333.wav|1|Yeah, and, I, eh, the other woman, eh, we found her in California, actually.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_431694_438341.wav|1|at the, we went to an old Indian village and found her there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_445509_451088.wav|1|The only thing, you know what the only thing I'm really not satisfied with in this room is?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_465135_468237.wav|1|And eh yeah, I just had this for, yeah, it broke.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_468317_471119.wav|1|So I have this just now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_475382_477644.wav|1|Yeah, but I, yeah, but I don't know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_480045_482647.wav|1|I want to take something that fits with the rest.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_54861_67127.wav|1|But yeah, I then, do you know, eh, is your cat like, because I know a little bit about cats and usually they love the sun.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_68067_77632.wav|1|So, but, eh, because first I was thinking to put the cat's place here instead and putting the resting and reading place in that corner.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_78232_82938.wav|1|But I'm not sure your cat will will stay in the, because it's darker here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_106094_110156.wav|1|You can maybe, you have to just find another place for your lamp.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_111176_114398.wav|1|And it could be in that corner, i have, because it's empty.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_114619_119142.wav|1|So we could perfectly... Or close to this, this beautiful painting here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_121263_123545.wav|1|And then we can make a, a cat space here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_165967_169448.wav|1|Then you're you're, happy you're lucky you have this big wall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_172749_177844.wav|1|Yeah, it's sure better here because the light is coming in from there, from from the door.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_178611_200542.wav|1|and so I think this this place so yeah if we have then we need to put the the couch a little bit here further was but that's no problem because there's space here and, ehh, yeah okay you can put it on the wall but then maybe you should you should change this this furniture
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_201202_208423.wav|1|so you have a, a, a longer one because if you have a big TV and have just once it will be strange
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_236118_242399.wav|1|Then we could, eh, if we put, yeah, then we will have two lamps.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_243139_251581.wav|1|But with the big screen we could maybe have the lamp to the right and we make this little reading place here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_251841_258623.wav|1|I think it fits if we make it, it's not really, it's a little bit close to the door.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_323968_329552.wav|1|Then would be would beautiful to have it next to the, the little table here, I think.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_402290_404571.wav|1|And I know a really nice shop.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_435749_439031.wav|1|It's attached here and you can turn it just in front of you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_440972_449071.wav|1|I have a really nice place in, eh, ehh, in south of, in eh Skanstull.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_457459_469361.wav|1|It's not often because, yeah, it's a bit complicated, but then they have we have to just think about which, where the L should be, that's really important.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_484351_488113.wav|1|But if it's big, it can't stay along the wall here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_501584_506648.wav|1|Yeah, because here you have place to make an L-sofa, it would be no problem at all.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_529476_538506.wav|1|I think it's all gets along, but you should have maybe hmm, could have more.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_540514_542555.wav|1|It's a little bit empty here, for example.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_543455_547157.wav|1|And this painting, you have to change it place with the big screen.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_547777_554640.wav|1|So you should put it ah, over, just oh, above the coat, the new sofa.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_557021_568426.wav|1|And here it will be really beautiful with a strip of, eh, this Japanese, you can have Japanese or eh, Kurbits, like from Dalecarlia.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_572109_574753.wav|1|It will be ve, very beautiful because you have this lamp there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_585637_588499.wav|1|It's so, it's strange and, and I like strange.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_592483_596186.wav|1|It will be very beautiful because now when you come in you don't see the lamp.

data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_64477_66751.wav|1|Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's normal.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_72504_74667.wav|1|Yes, yes, yes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_77682_82350.wav|1|I see it's a... it's still a in the stove it's a little bit dirty still.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_85278_92523.wav|1|I know it's hard to clean up, eh, because it's with the carbon from from winter and everything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_93180_97610.wav|1|But yeah, I, er, I would like to really clean it up a bit more.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_101745_110904.wav|1|Yeah otherwise... ah did you change the chair fr- eh from, in front of the... the desk?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_125881_128782.wav|1|This one is was even, more, nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_134972_138196.wav|1|Yeah, it seems, it seems very comfortable.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_142734_147998.wav|1|Yeah, this bla, black color is really... eh, I like the style.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_156100_162863.wav|1|It fits very well at the table with the computer and the, and the painting just next to it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_174589_176930.wav|1|Oh, this this pillow.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_179710_181736.wav|1|It's a bit dirty, no, isn't it?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_220513_224835.wav|1|Ah so yeah that's really nice that you cleaned some and you tried
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_264653_275571.wav|1|I understand but I see that the carpet changed a bit color and I think it's because of the sun. It has come... it has changed the color of the carpet.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_277288_285086.wav|1|It's lighter here in the the sides and darker over there so this is eeh
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_292562_301909.wav|1|yeah you did, I know you didn't do anything like wrong, but still it's not the same color.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_301989_304993.wav|1|I can't, for me, I can't use...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_311147_317993.wav|1|No, no, I mean that now that the carpet was here, you put it over here and the sun changed the color of it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_318133_327081.wav|1|So now we will be, I can't use this carpet for my new, the new persons that are renting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_392051_400706.wav|1|Otherwise, if it doesn't work, I mean, this is a solution that I give you because otherwise we have to, uh I can't give you back the whole deposit, you know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_378945_381694.wav|1|Because the people uh that are renting are coming tomorrow, so
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_232180_243953.wav|1|I see I see did you it's it seems like did you did you move the carpet like in front of the
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_40341_52926.wav|1|Ah, yes, you put the eh the coaches here, and this is not it's not perfect because you don't want to have the back to the light, you know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_53618_61134.wav|1|So I think that we should, I think we could change like pretty much everything here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_61660_66883.wav|1|Ah, yeah, because I think I think it would be really, really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_66878_72931.wav|1|It's pretty feng shui to put the table eh next to uh the the big windows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_82640_90947.wav|1|Yes, so regularly we want to have the tv at the place where it's the most dark in the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_96839_102437.wav|1|Here. It makes a reflection to the other painting there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_103369_108802.wav|1|It's a bit pity to put the lamps so close to the painting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_118020_123832.wav|1|Uh, you know, hiding the painting, doesn't give it the the its value correctly.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_126773_132883.wav|1|I see what you meant, but uh no, it doesn't work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_135064_141944.wav|1|And we should have, so, if you have the TV here, you should have the coach like, like there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_142833_145805.wav|1|Eh, it will be be-beautiful with this lamp.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_157922_164807.wav|1|And also then you can lay down, it's it's pretty nice laying down watching TV, in this direction.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_185671_191611.wav|1|It's pretty nice how you put the the little statues, you know, this ways here over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_192182_195792.wav|1|Eh, you can't put flowers in it because there's no place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_212430_215821.wav|1|Yeah, but that you can cut in the their feet.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_224269_228307.wav|1|For this way you should have more horizontal flowers, yes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_248163_255065.wav|1|Yeah, if you, eh the object down there, if you, if it's red, we should change that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_260575_262978.wav|1|but we can do the same thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_264087_266111.wav|1|Oh, we can change.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_267964_273671.wav|1|The small, the red with blue, the the over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_283717_288173.wav|1|Pretty nice, pretty nice, your your idea here, I like it, I like it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_288985_294328.wav|1|So then I have this painting there, with the table there, that's fine.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_295472_299258.wav|1|And eh, then we just move the the TV table, you know?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_311876_317016.wav|1|And we need to hide the garbage somewhere. You know you can't ha-have, it's really not beautiful.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_324281_327051.wav|1|Yeah, close, close.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_332461_335876.wav|1|Yeah, if you you make it smaller, I don't know if it's possible.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_348598_350787.wav|1|So do we know now?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_353353_355792.wav|1|So yeah, red.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_356438_359771.wav|1|Ah but we have then two red thing, we maybe should move...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_373958_376690.wav|1|Carpet? Yeah, we need to move it to the...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_410132_412491.wav|1|No, it doesn't, I I agree, I agree.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_447757_453892.wav|1|Yeah, you have to be careful with the patterns, because eh the paintings, they have already patterns.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_454250_458073.wav|1|And you have lots of objects, so if it patterns as well, it will be...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_459621_462348.wav|1|A bit messy. You don't want to have this messy feeling.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_481422_485043.wav|1|You have to really, it has to really fit in with the green walls.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_501273_504393.wav|1|But be careful so it's not too much green, you know?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_504897_510239.wav|1|But eh eh if you because, but green and pink, they get along very well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_510668_514732.wav|1|But if you uh buy more pink, then you have to change the shares.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_518301_520925.wav|1|But you could change your shares if you...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_525284_528393.wav|1|But maybe it's a little bit too much if it's pink shares and pink.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_531650_535833.wav|1|Oh... Yeah, but you have to paint them there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_540812_545363.wav|1|It would be really strange to cover the whole chairs with pink tissue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_549118_552082.wav|1|I think uh it's better to... And also...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_561901_565539.wav|1|I think it's it's not that different from the rest.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_579118_581838.wav|1|Yeah, white could be... could be a good idea!
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_582212_584308.wav|1|Yeah, it could be a good idea with the pink.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_585335_587953.wav|1|It depends on which pink you you choose.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_601897_606929.wav|1|It's it's like I have my okay my thumb is like
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_79206_81807.wav|1|And then, let's see.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_91436_95848.wav|1|So, I think we should put the tv there, the painting...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_109768_112600.wav|1|Ehmm, okay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_115034_117153.wav|1|Yes, it's a little bit...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_150635_154954.wav|1|Yeah, it will be really nice with the small coaches.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_197247_200206.wav|1|So uh we should switch that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_240874_247371.wav|1|You know, with the black background and the green walls, I think we should have pink flowers.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_256338_258964.wav|1|I like the way you put the dogs there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_328373_330401.wav|1|Inside? Yes, if you...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_377212_379471.wav|1|Eh closed, we uh, this has to stay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_390482_394367.wav|1|Yeah, it will be good with the statues there, there are mustard and...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_417152_420346.wav|1|Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's it's a good idea, but yeah,
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_422675_430266.wav|1|You should call me or or you should send pictures from the from the pillows first, I can...
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_472286_474471.wav|1|You can, yeah, you can color, but....
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_475101_480939.wav|1|You know, it's delicate, because uh th-these green, these green walls....
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_515199_517438.wav|1|Because they're brown-red, you know?
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_521476_525255.wav|1|If you like. with black or pink shares.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_593101_596532.wav|1|If you have the, you can also try the pink first.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_12215_15153.wav|5|Yeah, the location is amazing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_15377_29580.wav|5|And actually the view, I mean, here, the street, I think is really unique because this building is a little bit uh shifted from the street. So I think it's really nice that you can actually see the street and the cars can just go in this direction. It's really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_30164_39925.wav|5|But uh yeah, I mean, everything here is uh... I mean, sorry for the boxes. It's just I moved in quite recently. So, I mean, I I need to take care of that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_43921_50551.wav|5|Yes, because in these ones I packed really uh careful things like the... the horse... there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_52979_59311.wav|5|And, ehm and the big one was mar-, more for general things like the the the plushies and this kind of things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_59698_63205.wav|5|Yeah, uh I am a really big fan of bears, as you can see.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_66491_74719.wav|5|Eh, so this one, I I brought it from China. Because because I did an internship as a nanny bunny as a panda nanny.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_75309_79827.wav|5|So yeah, they gave me this as uh... Yeah, it was really, really nice experience.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_81741_104302.wav|5|And this one, uh, yeah, this one, I, I, I just purchased it, uh, on a natural reserve, uh, back in Romania. Cause the brown bears are really, really a a thing there. And I mean, yeah, they have issues with them in the, in the forests. Uh, so they attack people, but they are trying to protect them and just keep them on uh safe areas.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_109488_111503.wav|5|Eh yeah, the dog is it's a gift.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_111522_132732.wav|5|I don't really much like it, but it's actual marble so it costs a fortune. So, you know, I don't um I don't uh I I am not uh willing to to give it away or just throw it away because because it's really really costly but uh yeah, I I should sell it or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_137956_141786.wav|5|So uh I mean, this is kind of my work, as you can see.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_144087_151922.wav|5|I mean, these ones are pieces that I I find myself really drawn to because those were my my first pieces.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_152322_157673.wav|5|So I I give them as as a reminder of that you always need to remain humble.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_157991_168215.wav|5|Uh, especially the red one because that one as you can see it has a failure on the on the side. So that was one of my really first ones. So, you know, it's always good to keep a reminder there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_173092_175807.wav|5|Yeah, the blue one is one of the last collection.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_176041_179933.wav|5|So uh it's eh... you see there is a little bit of a difference in the shape.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_180358_184053.wav|5|And I think uh that one it's uh, it's really nice piece of art.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_184574_189643.wav|5|My my favorite favorite is the brown one, because that one is ah, it's
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_192484_202601.wav|5|Because uh that one is uh really special to me, because eh that one was a special uh set that we did for eh the King of Sweden.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_203343_210704.wav|5|Yeah, so uh he asked me to, to actually prepare one set specifically for him and I actually kept one of them just for me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_213391_217083.wav|5|That one i- is a a little bit of a new work that I am doing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_217409_220964.wav|5|So it's um, it's a little bit uh conceptual.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_221237_226891.wav|5|So it's how the the art deflates or how people lose interest in that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_230504_244406.wav|5|So uh I I think I went from bigger pieces to smaller pieces and in that sense uh I wanted to make a construction and maybe uh I could actually do a show with this and actually do the whole uh sequence.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_246340_253170.wav|5|Yeah, yeah, paintings is not uh actual my thing, but um, but yeah, I I really enjoy them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_253435_260132.wav|5|And also picture. So this one is a picture from a friend of mine. He does photography, and I think he's really, really talented.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_260487_263218.wav|5|And eh this one, eh it's a classic.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_263474_267987.wav|5|So this one ehm, it's a gift from one eh friend.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_268580_273801.wav|5|And this one, eh I actually purchased it to my friend because I really think it's really nice picture.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_274740_283451.wav|5|Uh and I actually put it there so ah ah the lamp can actually give some light to that one because it's a little bit dark.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_283839_289703.wav|5|So I think uh it it can be better appreciated, when it's ah with the lamp there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_292974_296775.wav|5|Ehm yes. Uh yeah, you're right. I mean, I think you are a little bit tall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_297000_299262.wav|5|For my height, it's uh it's okay, you know?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_300127_302551.wav|5|Yeah, you you are you're a little bit tall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_307354_310323.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, for me, as you can see, everything is to my reach.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_310967_315159.wav|5|So yeah, maybe I am um a little bit of a dwarf compared to you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_317375_328873.wav|5|Yeah yeah you you're a little bit big. Yes. Yes. As you might say... and as you can... as you can see I am also I am also really fan of plants. So I really like them. This is like my little baby, here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_331246_340508.wav|5|I really love them. I talk to them every day while I water them so... yeah they are my friends as well so I I really really love them, and give them love. All.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_347276_356790.wav|5|So uh yeah, I ah I I really love them. I... We have a s- strong relationship. And as you can see, they are super healthy because they really like me talking to them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_359110_362043.wav|5|And here I have my... my desk, my working area.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_362571_369154.wav|5|Eh, of course, for the finances, because you know when you have when you are an entrepreneur, you have to deal with your own finances.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_369562_372599.wav|5|But my study is uh you know far far off the street.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_375985_378830.wav|5|Yeah, a hundred percent because I don't want to mix work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_378860_381561.wav|5|I only keep like, you know, finished pieces.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_381883_384589.wav|5|But because otherwise, it's a little bit of a disaster.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_384871_391057.wav|5|Whenever you have the work at home, because everything gets messed up and uh dirty and uh you cannot stop.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_391746_394649.wav|5|So I think it's uh, it's for the best.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_397675_399767.wav|5|Yeah, one if... is for the studio.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_401437_405326.wav|5|And the card is uh for the um trash room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_405531_409077.wav|5|So uh it has um, yeah, it has a security.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_413725_419066.wav|5|Yes, it's a security thing because because they have uh people coming in to look for the paint.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_425314_430345.wav|5|Ah no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no of course not. I wouldn't keep a credit card there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_432268_436484.wav|5|But I was uh thinking of putting a little, little base or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_436800_440010.wav|5|They are just to put all these things because otherwise it looks a little bit messy.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_449491_457433.wav|5|Yes, but that one, I mean, yeah, I could put it there. But I wanted to get something different. I don't want to use my piece in that that sense. I think it's more of an art.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_457692_460225.wav|5|So I wanted something more functional to put there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_465085_467892.wav|5|But, you know, it's a temporary solution.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_468455_474616.wav|5|Because uh because, yeah, the the the bin, it's uh... It's hard to find nice bins.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_479164_489070.wav|5|Yeah, it's especially ugly, really. I want to hide it somewhere, but... thing is that I don't have any cupboard here and the the TV uh furniture is just transparent, of course.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_490867_513046.wav|5|Yeah, I need to remove this as well, but... No, but I need to purchase a new bin. Definitely, hundred percent something uh... You know... metal one or something like this. Aluminum. Something like this would work because I mean the style here is a little bit modern... or maybe black. But metallic one because that one looks really really ugly and plastic and you know, I don't like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_24903_26929.wav|5|Um, what what do you don't like?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_35616_43446.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, I think it's a little bit unbalanced, and maybe if you balanced it more appropriately, then it will actually work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_49405_60425.wav|5|I think um, yeah, I think the the mm actual problem, for example, with the with the one in the back, is that it doesn't it doesn't show, actually, because it's black on a black background.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_60780_75855.wav|5|So you need to do something like you did with that one there, which is white, and then the the the lady, uh that it's white, and then on a black background, then it actually, by contrast, you can actually see it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_76226_79331.wav|5|So uh the the one in the back it's actually not visible.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_80210_83941.wav|5|So I think ah you should move it to somewhere where where you can actually...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_86170_89313.wav|5|Yeah, of course. Or you can paint it in a color, I think.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_89632_92728.wav|5|Because uh that that could also add up to the situation.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_92962_98736.wav|5|Maybe you could have different colors that match uh perfectly the contrast with the with the pieces.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_99052_111055.wav|5|But then if you want to to remove some of the pieces, I think ah the the two ah pieces, the one the red one and the brown one there, eh those are the one down there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_111955_119649.wav|5|Uh the red one and the one down there. It's uh on the last shelf on the middle one. Yeah, the the the brown one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_119749_134843.wav|5|It's like a vase. Ehm. They mm they are too flat I think for for the rest the rest are more like vertical pieces and those are super horizontal pieces then it's not um... It's not working for the place I think
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_137538_154059.wav|5|Um yeah they are a little bit creepy but I mean it's it's a matter of uh choice i- if you don't like them you can actually remove them I think that that would be totally fine even maybe you can actually put some of these pieces there and then you can maybe have books here
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_158161_167408.wav|5|Eh I think the the orange one fits better with the with the rest of the composition than the... The green one it's a little bit sticking out and it's not eh that good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_172349_177531.wav|5|And then the paintings, I think having two of the same, it's not eh really a smart choice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_178019_183742.wav|5|I think maybe you can actually have two different or maybe just remove this one and keep that one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_184447_196891.wav|5|Because uh otherwise, I mean, in this space, you still have the TV here. So, uh I mean, that that'll that paint is not uh even visible for... I mean, it's it's not uh really well appreciated there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_210668_232407.wav|5|yeah of course I mean I think that the the lighting on the roof is really nice because it gives kind of a natural uh style so I think that that is good um regarding lamps yeah you might have too many of them so maybe this one I will remove this one I think it it might look nice in the night so uh I think this one you you might be able to keep it
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_233411_252027.wav|5|And the chandelier, the chandelier uh it's a little bit low, I mean in terms of height because you have a low table now so I think I would just change this whole setup and basically the table and the chairs a little bit upper because this looks like kindergarten style.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_256611_263644.wav|5|Um yes, you are right. I mean that's ah yeah, then maybe you should just just remove it because because yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_265263_279681.wav|5|Ah no, that wouldn't look nice. I think, ah yeah, you you can actually remove it because basically I mean the lighting here is really nice and I don't think you would need extra lighting for using the table for dinner for example. So then maybe you can actually remove it fully.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_286547_299932.wav|5|Yeah, maybe if you remove them, like.... in in in a cross shape, so that one, that one, that one, and that one, ah then then maybe it works. But I wouldn't I wouldn't bet on that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_300284_314629.wav|5|Maybe you can also ah make ehm a special lighting setup in which you can actually control buttons, and then you can actually control the lighting. So I want to turn this one and this one, and then you can just keep on changing the setup.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_314928_323340.wav|5|But anyways, I I I would recommend you just to remove the full thing because I don't think it it it it's providing anything to the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_329277_337118.wav|5|Yeah, I think that one, that one might work where the, the black one is, that it's not eh not being eh good right now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_339952_351829.wav|5|Yeah, the golden one, that... there it would really work nicely because ah you have a black background and then with the with the c- with the gold one it's gonna look nice, I think.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_357027_373488.wav|5|that one eh I think uh you should... place it in eh in another cupboard maybe you can remove one of the doors of the cupboards and then you can actually put it there because um I think that that one it's not working or maybe you just remove it because I don't think it's working
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_381732_384289.wav|5|So I would remove the one on the corner there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_388442_396832.wav|5|And also I feel that they are too too low in height, because like it's going to be really difficult to to stand up.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_397910_416291.wav|5|Yeah of course. So then then I think uh it would be it would be nice to go for a a higher um I mean yeah a whole set maybe you can actually have uh an l-shape um sofa so then it would be nice for you to be able to see the movies.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_417013_428722.wav|5|Uh I think that that can work and also I mean the tables I think they are thought for this height of uh couches, but if you go for higher height, then you need higher table as well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_432775_444610.wav|5|I think the size is nice, but though if you would like for a bigger size, I would just recommend a projector then because I don't know if you're gonna be able to mm to get a bigger size than this
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_448140_451459.wav|5|Ah, I mean, yeah, you can make like cinema style.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_451858_457274.wav|5|Eh but um, but I think this size is big, maybe for the room, you're right, maybe it's not big enough.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_457659_463960.wav|5|But maybe you can actually, um. Yeah, maybe you can put a projector directly and just work with that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_473141_478480.wav|5|Um I... then maybe y- you could pick a smaller table and then just with four chairs.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_479518_489349.wav|5|And uh in that in that case, uh I would pick like taller chairs again, I think this was this this whole room was make was made for a door.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_493706_498801.wav|5|Eh yeah, I think and I would pick a different color because this brownish celibate uh....
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_504010_515524.wav|5|Your laptop. If you actually pick this to be smaller you could put it a little bit inside and then you can make b- you can maybe have a desk area here so you can actually work with the with the laptop.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_516215_523144.wav|5|I think that that would work because uh like working in the laptop in the table I don't think that's functional for you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_534221_536530.wav|5|The plant in the middle of the couches?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_539016_543899.wav|5|That one, it seems like it doesn't have enough light because it's a little bit sad.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_544993_553246.wav|5|So I would just put them really, really next to the windows and where the sun comes because you're not facing south here, you're facing east.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_553415_563386.wav|5|So yeah, I would put it like next to the do- next to the door and really keep it there in the mornings because um I think it really needs some light.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_main_564042_568959.wav|5|Because if you compare with the other one, I think the light comes to that one, but not to this one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_1425_6829.wav|5|I just put my hands in front of my my mm, view, so I can check that they work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_27017_29561.wav|5|I mean uh I really like the decoration and all.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_29887_36688.wav|5|I did a great work here cause it's a little bit Asian style. So as you can see, all the furniture is really, really short.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_37160_51673.wav|5|So the idea, is, to have some old seat of course, but eh to be, you know in this eh, I mean Japanese culture and everything, that ah that everything is really low you know and you you you are, eating almost on the floor.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_52037_61066.wav|5|So I was really designing this whole place with that idea. I think it's really trending now, and I really like it and I think the the window and everything gives really that vibe.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_61722_68596.wav|5|And the balcony I mean, I think the whole setting is really nice and ah and it gives that kind of, vibe.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_71039_74849.wav|5|Yes, but eh that's because it is expensive actually yes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_75119_84102.wav|5|Ah, so ah I mean, the paintings, and and everything is uh, everything is really, really expensive. Uh even the sculptures there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_84494_93769.wav|5|Uh yeah they are from really really, um, renowned artists. And uh, I mean, not to brag but they are really expensive.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_97314_102558.wav|5|I mean, that painting is, ah neoclassic and it's uh really abstract.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_102899_112187.wav|5|And I really like that cause it gives a little bit of uh, of uh that vibe of uh something ethereum and something really, light.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_112528_134736.wav|5|So I think ah it really fits ah and and of course the composition with the lamp and the plant is, there so you get ah in in the night I mean when I turn on the lamp it gives a really nice vibe ah towards that corner because you have uh the light coming to the paint and then of course with the whole setting it gives really cozy environment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_137773_145793.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, that's that's a really particular sculpture because, the artist did this ah based on ah his childhood dog.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_146354_159715.wav|5|Ehm and I think it's really, really eh nice and humble from, in the side of the artist, cause, I mean, doing a sculpture of, your childhood dog or your childhood pet, I think that is really, really noble.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_160083_166907.wav|5|And ah, I I I think there is a lot of ah there's a lot of, emotion in that kind of work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_169356_187614.wav|5|Yeah, that that guy, it's from a different artist, ah but ah basically um, yeah, he did some ah some ah work, voluntary work, and he was working in this ah rescue, um animals from the street, of course ah, in different countries, but
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_187896_208536.wav|5|Ah, basically um there was this dog he really liked and um, and basically, ah he was, um one leg was hurt and that's why he's like lifting one leg and ah and basically he did a sculpture based on that dog and I I think it's really, ah it's a really nice story too behind it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_210289_219728.wav|5|Ah it's really it's really hard to pick actually um I don't know if I can actually make a decision, but my favorite from the whole room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_220162_224062.wav|5|It's the one in the back. The one in the back of black one
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_225733_227954.wav|5|Yeah, that that is that is my favorite one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_230592_236983.wav|5|So yeah, that that that that is what I like the most. And I don't know if you realized, ah but I have the same painting in both.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_237263_243600.wav|5|And it's just to generate an equilibrium because eh the Feng Shui says that we should keep an equilibrium on things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_243796_246337.wav|5|So that's why I want kept there and another here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_249997_254062.wav|5|Yes. And as you can see, of course also the colors, are really matching.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_254331_260865.wav|5|And ah I use ah some copper, and ah white. And I mean the colors are really really soothing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_262867_267149.wav|5|Ah yes, this is a gift ah, from a friend.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_267531_270089.wav|5|Ah, he inherited from his great-grandmother.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_270634_275658.wav|5|And it's ah an actual uh Art Nouveau um piece.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_278951_282424.wav|5|It's it's not a sculpture it's ah it's ah metalwork.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_282941_285395.wav|5|And eh it's really really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_287334_295291.wav|5|And um of course, it costs a fortune but, y'know my friend was like, no, I don't like this style and I was like oh my god this is so gorgeous.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_295579_298096.wav|5|I will just put it in my ah living room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_302104_307637.wav|5|Mm yeah this I wanted to make a separation, cause we have some kind of style there and some other different here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_310371_317530.wav|5|Eh so basically, eh in this side we have mol- more like modern pieces and in this one it's more, classic pieces.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_322840_325452.wav|5|Yeah. The red one is ah a really special one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_325702_340219.wav|5|It's a unique piece ah that I ash- actually asked for me cause um this artist would do this, in, orange that's her color normally but I was like, this piece would look, so nice in red.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_340463_347121.wav|5|And it, would actually fit with, whatever I wanted that it's just put a small, touches of color in my room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_347633_352020.wav|5|And then em, she made it for me specifically, that was that was great.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_365020_369473.wav|5|Ah, but yeah, I mean, I I maybe should set something next to door.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_369905_372317.wav|5|And then ah just ah to leave things there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_373012_375195.wav|5|Cause yeah, that might be you might be right.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_376893_382376.wav|5|But I was thinking of putting something to actually, um stand out, like a central piece.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_384673_387341.wav|5|I mean, this is ah, the keys, of the apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_387972_392858.wav|5|And that is ah, the card, for the entrance, cause we have a BIP code.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_394994_398598.wav|5|I mean, for the remote, I might leave it on the couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_400508_403990.wav|5|I mean, this is a movie style. I really like to watch movies.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_404350_411757.wav|5|And then this ah s-, this sofa is really working for that. So, the whole set is just put to be able to see the movies.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_412107_415280.wav|5|So I invite some friends over and and we watch the movies.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_422357_431691.wav|5|Ah, but now that you mention, yeah, I think one of the, one of the the service ladies took one because, in my last meeting, one of my friends spill something over.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_438366_443378.wav|5|Yeah, of course. But I think whenever it's ah it's back, she would put it there again, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_444109_448018.wav|5|Yeah, yeah. Cause she she puts a special products to remove the stains.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_449267_452199.wav|5|Even though, of course, it's everything designed for this kind of things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_452475_456244.wav|5|But still, she puts uh some extra products to remove it faster.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_476175_480166.wav|5|Eh it's because I, I have so much uh green.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_484588_490517.wav|5|No, I think it's just there because um, I wanted a minimalist approach.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_491104_499086.wav|5|So I, I don't want that many things. And also eh Feng Shui says that you shouldn't keep that many plants inside home cause they um they take oxygen.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_499626_501887.wav|5|And I mean, it's not good for your health.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_504479_512467.wav|5|Ah, the box is there just because I was unpacking one of the sculptures I sent for restoration cause one of my clumsy friends came and and
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_513629_521368.wav|5|They just drop it and then it broke. So. But I need to ask the lady that she just removed this cause yeah, that's n-, that's not good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_529356_532111.wav|5|Okay. I think they, they just forgot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_533398_535912.wav|5|Yeah, these ladies. Come on!
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_536895_540596.wav|5|Yeah, even the chairs are not aligned. I am really, really into details.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_540894_545311.wav|5|And I really like the chairs to be aligned and really close to the to the table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_554908_571676.wav|5|Yeah yeah yeah this is uh this is antique and uh yeah I... I got it, I got it from uh my dad's family, my grandma from my dad's side and then uh it was really nice cause um it's it's...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_575183_590663.wav|5|I haven't seen it in ah other places and I think it gives really... a really nice touch to the room and also it's like the center or the focus of attention from the table cause it gives like, uh, yeah, like a central point and a focus.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_595380_597841.wav|5|Um, my favorite item here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_605521_608256.wav|5|But I think that statue there, the white one, the lady.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_612881_617095.wav|5|Ah the least? Ah, the trash can. That trash can is awful.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_619763_622282.wav|5|But uh I need to find a replacement for that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_622758_628392.wav|5|And ah, it's ah, it's a little bit hard to find a trash can that matches the place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_628685_631559.wav|5|Cause trash cans are not really well designed, actually.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_632165_634851.wav|5|And ah, and then it's really complicated, you know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_635743_639788.wav|5|Even though it was really expensive, but it's not... it doesn't match the place quite well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_642272_666041.wav|5|Uh which one? This one? Ah, it's uh... I mean I keep it it's, it's dearest to my heart because... Um you know, it was my aunts and I had a really special, um relationship with her. It might, you might be right that it doesn't match really the decoration of the room, but it's really really dearest to my heart. So I... I really wanted to keep it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_679205_688488.wav|5|Ah, it's because they... they are for different uh situations. So whenever I am chilling here, then the lights on the app are not on and I just keep the lamps.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_688728_692484.wav|5|And then eh whenever I have the lights on, then I don't keep the lamps.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_692787_695470.wav|5|It's it's eh... It's more of a true situation thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_695934_705142.wav|5|But if I need to pick, I would pick my aunt's one, cause, you know, that's really special. Though I really like that one. I think it really matches with the... with the room style.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_712292_714883.wav|5|Mm yeah it's a simple lamp, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_718741_720947.wav|5|Aha. No, no, no, no, no. No, not really.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_722096_726431.wav|5|But I might consider that because you know, in winter, th- the plants don't get enough light.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_726934_736999.wav|5|Uh so yeah, but but yeah, I mean, sometimes, eh whenever it's not, I mean, eh there is not that much light, I take them out in the balcony.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_737560_740640.wav|5|Eh cause cause it it's nice for them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_750233_764382.wav|5|But I don't think so. I think it looks nice. It's a nice division and it it gives you a nice view of the... I mean, it's a cen- it's a focus point that then leads you to the... to the green garden, yes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_767668_772434.wav|5|Um no, I mean, ah it might have been a little bit damaged with the moving.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_773314_779986.wav|5|Cause, um yeah, I mean, they need a certain time to get used of the place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_main_781658_785408.wav|5|But I I I am sure that it will actually recover.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_13964_21187.wav|5|Yes, it has been a long time, and you have been a really good uh tenant as far as I can see, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_33275_35576.wav|5|And yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_38009_40457.wav|5|So did you face any difficulties here?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_52171_54644.wav|5|Ah, it was a different color or you painted it?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_60617_66192.wav|5|Y- yes, please, because uh I I don't think this color matches the decoration of the place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_66906_69563.wav|5|Yeah, I I think it's it's for the best.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_70724_74347.wav|5|Yeah, and I I I I see you did great job with the plants.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_75562_78530.wav|5|Those ones on the roof, uh you actually um...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_80204_82701.wav|5|You actually put them by yourself?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_89329_93787.wav|5|Yeah, but but I am not sure that we should keep them there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_94187_98606.wav|5|Because I I mean, you know how to uh water them and everything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_98855_102487.wav|5|But if a new tenant comes, I don't feel that they are gonna...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_103072_108293.wav|5|know how to deal with this. So I think maybe you just remove them and and just cover the holes, please.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_111857_114668.wav|5|Because, yeah, I don't I don't think they will...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_132904_136631.wav|5|Yeah, but but I mean, it's because in summer there's so much light coming in.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_136987_140295.wav|5|So uh it was just to keep the room a little bit dark.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_141042_145096.wav|5|So uh yeah, if you could put them back it's, it would be really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_157192_162842.wav|5|But though ah I mean, the green one, yeah, change it back. But the other one, I think it's nice. You can... you can
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_164279_168081.wav|5|Ah okay, okay, then yeah, okay. He dressed my own decorations.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_171057_174065.wav|5|Ah that that that bin there was not the one that was here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_175613_181640.wav|5|The the black bin, trash can ah it was it was not like that that... it was a metal one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_186674_193895.wav|5|Ah, okay, perfect, but this one you can take it with you because it's yours and then ah let's just bring back the the metal one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_194450_197621.wav|5|I think uh it it it it fits better with the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_219593_223123.wav|5|Yeah, but um... uh what what what happened?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_231831_235543.wav|5|Okay, that's great, because maybe I can just send it for restoration.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_235997_246054.wav|5|And then uh maybe, yeah, you would just need to cover what's uh taken from the work of doing the restoration, because uh I don't want to charge you with the whole statue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_246347_250299.wav|5|So maybe we can actually ah reach an agreement there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_256217_262340.wav|5|Ah now you can see the paints; you you, you didn't touch anything, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_263647_267154.wav|5|Ah because ah I mean uh regarding the cleaning
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_271817_283164.wav|5|because because I see some some a little bit stains on the on the on the mm on the glass so so I guess maybe you cleaned them, but you didn't ah pay close attention
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_287858_291267.wav|5|Ah, okay, then then maybe that's why you should clean them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_291745_297771.wav|5|I mean, they they all have a frame and and and a glass, so ah you won't do any damage to it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_298123_302194.wav|5|You can just clean it with a wet wipe, like you would clean a a window.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_319118_323988.wav|5|Ah but yeah, y- y- you you know that you need to ask for permission to do this kind of things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_325132_327194.wav|5|Ah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_328163_333303.wav|5|I mean, just just leave it like that. I mean, there's not much to do; if you actually painted it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_338818_343873.wav|5|Ah, y- yeah, I I don't agree with you, but uh I mean, it is what it is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_349162_352151.wav|5|But I think uh, is is... is that a stain?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_354962_357257.wav|5|Is that a stain there on the couch?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_358516_364079.wav|5|Yeah, on the down part it's a little bit ; clearer than the couch. Oh or is like...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_364671_369040.wav|5|Or you put... your shoes there. I mean, I don't... I am not sure what is... what is wrong.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_370613_375076.wav|5|Yeah it's, it's a little bit clearer than than the rest.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_375458_380941.wav|5|I don't know if it's like uh just used or or there is a stain there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_386218_391808.wav|5|Yes, please do that. Otherwise, I think you need to thoroughly clean it because it was not like that before.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_396733_399328.wav|5|And in this one, there used to be a pillow. What happened with that one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_400681_403311.wav|5|In in the black uh couch. Yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_406605_411750.wav|5|OK, good. If we can actually ah put it back, it would be perfect.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_413857_415881.wav|5|And the rest I think you took good care.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_26676_31425.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, I think uh you can give you some, you can give it some personal touches.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_31833_45565.wav|5|I mean, eh you told me before that you uh were into this eclectic style, so I think the, the carpet gives uh really that vibe, but maybe you need some other items that can give this look.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_45751_50177.wav|5|For example, the lamp in the back, maybe it's a little bit generic, that one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_51067_56935.wav|5|It's a little bit generic, you can go for something uh more bold in terms of uh style.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_57247_63250.wav|5|So it would actually fit better with the whole room and with the carpet itself.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_66593_73621.wav|5|Yes, that o- that that is a little bit better, you know, towards the the look of the room. I think that is that is better.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_73983_82603.wav|5|But also the couch, I think, um yeah, the brown, it's a little bit ah too plain for this room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_84317_96268.wav|5|Ah, the black one is better, and I think also if you can put some uh spots of color with the with the blanket and with the pillow and this kind of things, it would actually look better.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_107216_114449.wav|5|Ehm yeah, maybe maybe you can you can have a small table, like a coffee table ah in in in the green.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_115035_117845.wav|5|That ah that I think uh might look nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_118478_125478.wav|5|Ah but maybe that green, it's a little bit too uh saturated. Maybe you can go for something more pastel.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_125664_135437.wav|5|Because these colors here, I mean, you have blue, orange. I mean, I am basing everything with the carpet because I think it's a really nice um item and you you like to keep it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_135643_164134.wav|5|So maybe orange, that would be also another option and maybe you can keep really small ah... Maybe a smaller cushion for... uh in green so you have a little bit more of contrast. But I was a little bit worried about this situation here. Ah yes, because eh that statue there it doesn't look good because maybe you can move this um couch a little bit back, and then put it in between both couches because... it it doesn't
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_164831_167162.wav|5|Y- you are not able to see it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_169086_172845.wav|5|Th- this armchair, the black one, you move it a little bit back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_173809_176346.wav|5|And then you move the table a little bit forward.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_176689_183221.wav|5|And then you would have an option to actually see the statue, because otherwise eh you don't see it at all.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_183737_189728.wav|5|And also the trash can in the back, I wouldn't really put it there. It's it it doesn't look good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_192033_196555.wav|5|Yeah, and that that doesn't look good, because it's too plastic.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_196615_211099.wav|5|H- I I I w- I would ah purchase something metallic or things like this, and maybe not put it like, just there, maybe put it in in some other corner of the room, like here, there is nothing, so something more like open.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_212263_214832.wav|5|I think that that would that would uh go better.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_215122_220943.wav|5|And even, for example, the statue there, close to the TV, I think eh it's distracting from the TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_225678_233089.wav|5|Yeah, but I think it would be nice for you to have a a spa- a space specifically designed for the statues.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_233284_239871.wav|5|Maybe you can put a shelf or something where you can actually put them, and then it's a place for the statues to actually...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_242500_252761.wav|5|you can do the thing with the moving, or maybe put both of them on the same table, or maybe you can actually put one here and get another table, small one, eh to put the other one, or maybe a shelf.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_269877_273684.wav|5|I think it's ah there are two different situations here, and it's OK.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_274149_278118.wav|5|But I think that chair there, it's a little bit maybe not that comfortable.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_278349_282818.wav|5|I mean, I don't know, uh you use this space for reading or something like...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_283937_293862.wav|5|Ah okay, but then maybe you need a yeah, you need a more comfortable space because I think uh the area is not uh... that that chair is not uh... Yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_295640_303648.wav|5|Yeah, it's really inspiring but I would maybe uh... Get something more comfortable reclinable like y- you can lay it down a little bit.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_main_304219_308296.wav|5|Maybe something like that. Maybe some focal light that comes directly on top.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_8849_18624.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, you have uh had a short stay here, but uh w- why would you like to leave? I mean, I I don't understand it. Everything is... so nice in this apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_27751_30690.wav|5|Well, yeah, but let's check. Uh. Did you do the cleaning?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_43572_46195.wav|5|Did you break... the panda?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_47954_51518.wav|5|Yeah, look! It looks like the the arm is stitched.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_53477_57124.wav|5|No, it was... it's an original panda from Hong Kong.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_64158_66373.wav|5|Oh, come on, it's funny for you, this?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_78583_81490.wav|5|We will check, definitely we will check on the pictures.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_82447_84811.wav|5|This is unacceptable, unacceptable.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_104155_106416.wav|5|You cleaned the painting and you did it wrong.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_122479_125668.wav|5|What w-? which kind? which kind? of cleaning?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_130105_133582.wav|5|Well, they they robbed you because this is just so badly done.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_139799_143128.wav|5|Yeah, hundred percent, because this is not acceptable, really.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_152633_156406.wav|5|Did you... break the glass? Of the... TV?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_158582_160634.wav|5|Yeah, I can see I can see a line there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_163165_167970.wav|5|Your hair? You said that you hired people to clean and you say that that mark is your hair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_172440_175744.wav|5|I understand, I don't see how th-... your hair will reach that point.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_188148_190937.wav|5|I think I might not be able to give you your deposit back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_212452_217719.wav|5|Okay, okay, that's that's good. But please put it back because uh it needs to be there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_221844_225419.wav|5|But then eh after, can you show me that it's actually in good state?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_225836_232777.wav|5|Because... because now I am not really sure. I mean, after the panda, I cannot believe y- you just sewed the arm.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_237030_239978.wav|5|Were you drinking coffee or eating here? I mean, this has...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_246428_248514.wav|5|The the the purple pillows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_252669_254833.wav|5|I really hope it is water only, please.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_266108_268623.wav|5|Yeah, but but you didn't report that it was broken.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_273123_275806.wav|5|I will check my emails. Yes, yes, hundred percent.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_299266_301572.wav|5|an inspection here... and you're just playing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_317330_319621.wav|5|Everything is not water in this life, you know?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_325050_330672.wav|5|and I will actually check on the apartment and I hope everything is... really how it should be.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_14958_19187.wav|5|So hi, how are you? I think uh you made a good choice purchasing this one no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_25483_32165.wav|5|Yeah, yeah, of course. I mean um, first of all, I think the color, it's not the most favorable one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_32487_39183.wav|5|I would I would go for something more uh neutral, like white or a l- really light gray.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_41872_46084.wav|5|Because uh because really, I I don't think this color really matches.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_47270_58118.wav|5|I mean...  it matches but the the problem is that eh it might be too much if you want something more like a a place where you can take some rest and stay in the night like watch some TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_58377_64162.wav|5|Maybe you don't want so much information incoming. Same with the with the mm pictures.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_77725_83720.wav|5|Ah... I mean, I think in this case, you should decide because ah so the flooring is gray.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_84011_94273.wav|5|So uh I don't know if the furniture should be gray, same as the floor, or you want to keep this um this color because
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_97563_100631.wav|5|Eh no, the tables, the table and the and the furniture there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_109320_112158.wav|5|So in that case, maybe I would go for something lighter
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_112542_116630.wav|5|if you want like uh more uh es- ah space to take some rest.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_117255_140924.wav|5|With um with the sofas ah I would just put them in a different eh direction so I would put... keep the big one in the center and then the small one on the side and then maybe you can get another to put on the other side or maybe you can actually purchase one new one in L shape and then it would be nice because you can see more people and then you can also lay on on the sofa that would be nice
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_141350_155730.wav|5|And towards the color I would go for something lighter and then I would just put a little bit of a pop of color with some pillows or some other um you know decorations that you can put on like a little blanket or something like this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_159234_164211.wav|5|Uh I think that table is, uh, I mean, for that placement, it's really big.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_164620_172999.wav|5|So you need to go for something ah more minimalist in terms of maybe choose small ones, like a little bit short in eh in height.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_174992_177348.wav|5|Ah, y- eh you mean the desk for the mm, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_177739_185640.wav|5|I mean, that desk is a little bit uh confusing in position, because because you have the fireplace here, and maybe you want to make that your focal point.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_186175_201934.wav|5|Because uh maybe the TV would look really nice on top of the of the fireplace, and then you can move the desk toward this area here, maybe next to the window, which would be nice if you work here to have some natural light while you're working. I think that would be nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_207229_217253.wav|5|Your laptop, I mean, if you're if you're actually working ah in the couch, then maybe you can ah get one of those tables that you can flip and and take back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_217532_225150.wav|5|Like ah, y- y- you lift them, and then you put... put them closer to to the couch, and then you can work there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_236314_255769.wav|5|Yeah, I I wouldn't I wouldn't put like the laptop close by to the s- to the statues because, in that case you would be uh moving the laptop or just working there and then... I mean you're really close to the statues and then maybe some ah accident happens and then you break some of uh the statues. So I I wouldn't do that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_255866_266008.wav|5|I I I think this is more of a static area in which, you don't want, nothing much to happen because it's more of a a place to actually eh l- take a look.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_266486_268941.wav|5|But uh but yeah, I don't I don't know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_269111_271391.wav|5|I don't think uh I would put the laptop there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_281045_284630.wav|5|I think uh the black one would be the best uh choice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_285147_293278.wav|5|Uh yeah, the brown one, it's i- l- it's looks little bit flat in this furniture, because uh it's the same color of the furniture.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_293591_300743.wav|5|But eve- but if you wish to actually change the color of the furniture, maybe the brown one, it would be a better choice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_306538_309336.wav|5|Yeah, I think ah maybe you should just keep one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_309831_312828.wav|5|Because now with the two of them, it's a little bit too much.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_313271_317316.wav|5|So maybe if you just keep one of them, eh I would go definitely for that one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_320978_327156.wav|5|Because uh really, it's not uh... I mean, it it matches better with the whole uh room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_327662_330640.wav|5|This one, it looks like trash can from the street.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_331575_334074.wav|5|The blue one looks like the trash can from the street.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_334447_343595.wav|5|So, it it I mean, I would keep that inside a a a drawer or inside a cupboard, something like that, hidden, like not to be visible for the people.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_355685_363226.wav|5|But as I was saying, maybe if you move the TV on the upper part of the fireplace, then maybe you can put one, there, in in the place of the TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_365010_367302.wav|5|Even the the color pick is really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_367567_378899.wav|5|But from the rest, if you have to pick one and we would have like this grayish walls, I would go for this one, ah to keep and just put it there, even because it goes with the eh
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_379130_386215.wav|5|theme, so you would have landscape and landscape, because the other two I think they are a little bit different in in the theme
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_387604_395752.wav|5|I think you should remove this one and that one, and this one move it there and the TV move it... on top of the mm fireplace.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_406009_426801.wav|5|Ah yes, yes, you definitely eh purchase one of those... small um... arrangements for the the next of...  uh for the side of the... so where you put... place your arm, and then you can just put put it there even with the control uh the the the control of the TV... the remote control. So uh you can put everything there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_429586_434690.wav|5|Yeah, I think uh you can buy one of those um... places where you can keep it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_435090_442793.wav|5|Like uh they're... nn they come in different uh... colors and yeah, it's like a little bit uh more organized in that sense.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_101347_109087.wav|5|Yeah, because uh I can see that they are from the same, same color, little bit brown, eh but like really saturated brown.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_9_2172.wav|5|Little bit towards the left.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_10542_13225.wav|5|You need me to uh point at things more or?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_24119_27260.wav|5|Yeah, okay, I hope you you have taken care of the things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_27545_31083.wav|5|really thoroughly, so ah you you actually performed the cleaning.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_33115_41137.wav|5|Ah, but you know, I am just uh, but... There is a stain on... on the pillow.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_42412_46988.wav|5|But I mean, th- th- that's not supposed to be like that. Yeah, I can I can actually see it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_50918_53260.wav|5|Aha, okay, okay. Yeah, that's good, that's good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_57506_59793.wav|5|I mean, there is... there is a mark on the wall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_64050_69784.wav|5|Yeah, yeah, le- le- let's check that because, because, yeah, I I don't think that was there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_77879_81434.wav|5|The black one, because uh it was doing this with the finger...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_95437_99395.wav|5|Yeah, yeah, hundred percent. Because, yeah, it really, it had a finger pointing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_103884_113167.wav|5|I think ah... yeah, you have a lot of things from yours here, right? Because, I mean, that trash bin was not from the apartment, the blue one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_126264_128964.wav|5|So, uh, and that that's also your computer, I guess.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_148633_155209.wav|5|Yeah, the problem is that, you know, whenever the weight is on, then it leaves a mark on the on the carpet.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_160989_163519.wav|5|So, ah, did y- did you move the lamp to clean?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_166851_169766.wav|5|Because because I can see some dust in the back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_174000_177542.wav|5|Yeah, please, please do that because I can still see dirt.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_181088_185613.wav|5|I mean, this this furniture looks great. I think you took good care of it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_185858_188023.wav|5|Is the TV ah working right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_198693_202959.wav|5|The container the vase for the the the plants for watering the plants?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_206011_215674.wav|5|Yeah uh, yeah if y- if you if you could just actually put it back to w- where it was, because I think it's important for... for the next one, so I can keep track of the changes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_218369_220441.wav|5|By the... by the fireplace, as it was.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_221677_226272.wav|5|Yeah, I think the the windows are a little bit dirty.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_227140_230806.wav|5|I mean, did you did you clean from inside and outside or just inside?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_231692_239194.wav|5|Yeah, yeah, I think you need to to recheck them on the outside because I can see some stains from the rain and that doesn't look good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_251537_253664.wav|5|What happened? There, on the door?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_260314_262339.wav|5|Yeah, I can actually see a mark.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_270491_273571.wav|5|I mean, because because it looks like a stain, I don't know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_276955_283738.wav|5|Nice, nice, you took care of the plant. That that is really nice. I... I.. looks... looks nice and taken care of.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_288177_296493.wav|5|But but so so the the hand here, ah the sculpture, it has a scratch on the... on the palm.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_301733_305442.wav|5|I am not so sure about that. I think it's... it was not there before.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_308835_314781.wav|5|Yeah yeah, we should check it on the pictures because... because really it's not uh... I don't think it was there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_319484_325719.wav|5|Yeah, please, please. Uh s- so so move it because uh yeah, and also the... the newspaper there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_325865_331885.wav|5|I mean, try to move all your stuff, because otherwise, it's not good for the rest.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_344762_347837.wav|5|Yeah, I was actually going to comment abou- about that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_348050_351214.wav|5|But I I can actually, I mean ho-, did you clean them?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_354228_370460.wav|5|Because I can see a little bit of dust. Maybe you can... just... ah put a l- ah a little bit, ah clean it. Because, yeah, on the upper part, especially, i- i- you can see an actual uh you know layer of dust that doesn't
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_371821_379931.wav|5|No, of course, of course. But y- you know, when you have the frame, so in the upper part and in the lower part, there is a little bit of line of dust.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_398430_415200.wav|5|The ones that uh don't have a frame like those, eh those ones are not that problematic, but these ones that have a frame are n-, you don't have to take that much care in terms of uh damaging them, because they have like a glass, so you can actually clean them normally.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_415488_421162.wav|5|The the the ones that you need to take more care about are those ones, ah because they don't have a frame.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_002_main_431317_437100.wav|5|Yeah sure, and let's check this... those marks because otherwise I won't be able to give your whole deposit back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_22160_26403.wav|5|It's a great choice, actually, because I think you have a lot of natural light coming in.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_28972_41794.wav|5|But uh I would like uh also you to tell me, I mean, the purpose of this room is more like a a cozy room to take some rest when you come back from work or or mean, what's the purpose as well?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_42550_48613.wav|5|So y- you want to watch movies. I mean, what what if you can tell me a little bit, what is the purpose?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_59261_80167.wav|5|Okay, I see. Yeah. But but then maybe uh... Yeah, the the dark couches are not really good with that because I think if you want to chill and relax you need more light colors. So I think maybe I would go for a beige uh color for the for the couches or gray light gray that could also work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_80851_84352.wav|5|I think uh yeah you you might need to reconsider that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_86360_91811.wav|5|I would put the big one there ehn just to see the TV I mean and be comfortable with it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_94074_97455.wav|5|I think... Or just put it in another place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_101208_107278.wav|5|Maybe if you have one of this size there, uh that would be nice. Or you could have two of them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_109798_111869.wav|5|But you should change the color, of course.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_112055_115937.wav|5|And maybe this one, you can just put it somewhere else, or maybe put it there as well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_116329_120965.wav|5|And uh you can have a like a reading area, and then you have the TV area.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_123304_128501.wav|5|But maybe that table there, the one with box, I think uh that is not really functional.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_129631_134300.wav|5|Um... Maybe I... I would just take it out and move this lamp, there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_135006_137377.wav|5|So you have more of a cozy environment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_140877_154783.wav|5|Yeah, I think that table should go away. Yeah, I think that that could work and and this table um I mean, I don't know if it's actual f- actually functional for you but um
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_158091_162295.wav|5|Yeah, but maybe it's too low. Maybe you need a little bit something higher.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_165268_173696.wav|5|No, I mean, you can place the items, but maybe you can uh get a higher one and then with the with the um library so you can put the books in the library.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_179301_186840.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, uh you could you could uh get a library there as well, and then you can put the books and things ah just there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_188478_203395.wav|5|Yeah but I think the keys are are better to have them close to the door so maybe you can put a small table here, like, like th- that one maybe move it here and then you can just keep the keys and things in that corner
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_207635_222566.wav|5|Tha- the statue? No not that not that table the table the the small one here with the drawer, because you can open the drawer and put things there inside as well. So I think that that might work. Of course the computer I don't... Do you keep it there normally?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_228526_236689.wav|5|No, no, hundred percent, but I think maybe then eh that is not the best eh table to keep the the computer.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_237692_241848.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, yeah, I would just go for something more functional for you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_243021_251974.wav|5|Eh... Maybe you can get something that uh reclines a little bit so you can have different heights and different angles. That that could work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_253877_259849.wav|5|And I think also you could put some color with the with the pillows because these pillows are like really dark.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_264762_271486.wav|5|I I w- I would use a little bit more, more color because in the carpet you have red so I would just give pops of red if you want.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_273281_278587.wav|5|But of course really controlled like in small doses because you want this place to be a relaxing place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_282653_289739.wav|5|I mean, if you have the the gray, um the the the gray furniture then I think it might be better.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_290548_304461.wav|5|Ah but I will just go more for clear colors, like ah white or beige or ochre or this kind of colors that ah are ah more easy to, ah to see ah for a long period of time.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_309979_331015.wav|5|Yeah, I mean I think for that, you could use this area as well. And and and... purchase one of those uh or- organizers in which you can put your personal stuff, like one space for the keys and the watch and even that is better because whenever you leave the place, then you can actually keep track of what you take with you and whatnot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_331848_334591.wav|5|So I think that that would be uh that would be good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_338570_342136.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, the that shelf is a little bit up.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_346763_349947.wav|5|I mean, you can maybe hang it, from the roof.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_351584_358469.wav|5|Or also you can um you can purchase one of those uh settings in which you can put them next to the window.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_359249_361859.wav|5|So uh hang it kind of to the window.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_362385_365254.wav|5|And then and then it will definitely get enough light.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_376649_379613.wav|5|I mean, eh for that, I think you have too much happening on this room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_381992_384742.wav|5|I mean, it's not about liking, I think it's about position.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_385291_391186.wav|5|So I think these two fit really nicely together because they have the same style, the same framing, kind of.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_393335_396430.wav|5|So I would maybe move this one here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_396933_400333.wav|5|And then you have one focal point here with the TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_421443_424351.wav|5|I I I don't know why you need, you need two of them, actually.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_433962_436674.wav|5|Because it matches a little bit with the carpet.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_440544_446714.wav|5|And I would put that in not such a visible area, maybe in the back, whenever, uh yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_459658_466498.wav|5|I think it's good. I think it gives uh kind of a focal point as well, but I would actually put it in an in a higher table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_467050_471612.wav|5|Because I... I think there it doesn't... it doesn't show that much.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_471818_478134.wav|5|So it's it's not something that you will stare at looking. So I think if you put it in a higher table, then it will look better.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_484342_494909.wav|5|Yeah, I mean that that could definitely work though they are... from different styles. So maybe if you move your plant, then you can put one in each corner and then that that might work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_497319_507671.wav|5|I think it's um it's a little bit... Merging with the wall, so it's not really uh... Taking the best out of it maybe if you actually
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_510038_514745.wav|5|Yeah, I think it's not the best color, for the room and the statue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_515079_517689.wav|5|I think they are not uh matching properly.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_518184_531356.wav|5|But maybe maybe if you if you put a small table, like two small tables next, I mean, i- on both sides of the fireplace, then maybe you can put them and then they will have this beige... Eh, it went off.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_19740_23278.wav|5|Okay, yeah, you're not uh in the middle of anything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_29223_38590.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, I have my my you know thoughts about it, because I think I didn't really catch the... the essence of the place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_38853_47809.wav|5|So I I was planning to do some changes, but um but do you have some uh suggestion that you think that I should uh change?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_54513_60992.wav|5|No, of course I am, I am, but uh but you know, I don't know, I am a little bit in doubt about that paint there, the flower ones.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_61231_67141.wav|5|So I don't know, I am not uh fully, but that that's that's mainly the the only thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_70028_75441.wav|5|Yeah, that's true. I mean, they are the same size and they are a little bit, but I think I I should go more for something that style.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_76977_93042.wav|5|The yeah the tree one like just go uh or or get one on that style on the outside. I think the the they are not uh matching styles and that l- that little bit bothers me. But I think I did a really great work with the plants there on the roof, hanging on the roof that I really like.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_93332_101534.wav|5|It's a little bit... hassle to water them, but now I purchased a system that it does it by itself.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_102752_107231.wav|5|You know, it costs a little bit of a fortune, but you know, it's, it's, it's okay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_116123_120471.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, they all have my, you know, a little bit of a piece of my heart.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_127348_130484.wav|5|Yeah, ah I really like that one. It's, uh it's really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_130744_140088.wav|5|I think I I should purchase a a nicer vase for the, like, nicer pot, because uh it's growing and I think I need to replant it soon.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_140406_145219.wav|5|So but but yes, I think ah i- it's, that is the one that I like the most.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_150333_157280.wav|5|Yeah, it's but this one is especially... designed for that. So it's a really it's it's a plant that doesn't require that much light.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_157684_160529.wav|5|So uh it's it's good f- for that purpose.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_160840_169357.wav|5|So that's why I k- I keep it here, because now in the summer, then you know a lot of light enters through the windows, and then it it's too much for for it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_169357_174460.wav|5|As you can see, the the upper part... of the leaves is a little bit uh you know not good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_174824_177159.wav|5|It's because I moved it quite recently.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_177537_184433.wav|5|So basically eh in winter my plan is to put it next to the window, but now as it doesn't require that much sun I moved it here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_184529_188598.wav|5|It's a l- little bit of a big plant so that's ah a little bit complicated to move.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_194370_200380.wav|5|Yeah yeah, I wanted to to l- give a little bit of a pop-up color ah to both of them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_200602_205181.wav|5|So, you know, ah just to to cheer up th- the the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_213322_215465.wav|5|From the walls, you mean, or the w- the the pillow?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_217416_228285.wav|5|Aha, yeah, but ah it's just, you know, to do while you watch TV or something and you want to... to put it like in your knees or like on your head. So it's not, I don't eat at all in the couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_228552_235408.wav|5|So uh I don't think... maybe and I if I drink, I drink just water, things like that. So I don't, I don't, I'm not afraid.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_235625_243589.wav|5|But anyways, they are both ah impermeable and the filling can be removed so I can actually wash them, on the washing machine.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_249762_252817.wav|5|I was just checking some some things from work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_253182_259702.wav|5|But um but yeah, normally I have uh a desk eh in another room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_263299_267448.wav|5|Well, that's a that's a really good uh observation, actually.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_269523_275102.wav|5|Ah, yeah, I should maybe purchase a auxiliary table for the laptop.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_278259_286374.wav|5|Yeah, I was I was thinking more of one that can actually fit the height, because that one there that has the statue, first of all, it has the statue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_286697_290034.wav|5|And second of all, ah it's a little bit too low for me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_290267_293296.wav|5|So I was thinking of getting something a little bit uh higher.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_300595_305765.wav|5|So ah I I said, okay, I deserve my space to actually do this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_305998_313824.wav|5|So that's why I have this uh with the little lamp and you know, in the night, I just turn everything off and just keep a lamp and it's really cozy.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_318644_322328.wav|5|Yeah, it's because otherwise this ah area was a little bit dark.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_322865_331210.wav|5|Ah but uh so yeah, a- as you can see, you have one here, one there, one there. So it's crossing the room, and it keeps it uh the whole room illuminated.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_331414_337763.wav|5|But ah actually, you can turn them on separately, which is really nice. So you can have different areas illuminated in the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_main_338078_352428.wav|5|sometimes when I am reading and I feel that I don't have that much light I just turn that on. But uh otherwise I just keep this setup here with the small lamp and the chair and I just read something have a glass of wine or something that's really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_23395_45088.wav|5|I really put a lot of effort to, you know, decorate it and ah put all the tiny details that I like ah on my space you know. I... it's really important for me, all the details that I... I put in each thing. For example, I mean, all the vases and the sculptures that I have, I mean I... just detailedly selected them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_74099_80881.wav|5|So, for example, with the couches and the grey and, you know, everything is uh... a little bit balanced, let's say.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_91467_98384.wav|5|Okay, yeah, that is a really, really eh nice sculpture that a friend of mine gifted me uh on a trip to Africa.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_98828_110724.wav|5|So um she found it on a fair and she told me that it was really, really nice and that the person who made them eh was uh an old man who was carving them by hand.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_110896_113574.wav|5|So I think it's really special for me in that sense.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_116444_124105.wav|5|Yeah, and the other one is eh one that I I personally like, because it's from an artist that I really uh enjoy.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_124484_128530.wav|5|Eh he's not so really renowned, but ah I really like his work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_128902_132545.wav|5|And eh it's uh marble, so it's card marble.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_132881_140304.wav|5|And I really like the details, like the way it's uh lifting the hand. I really like that, it's uh... It's a message of hope.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_159203_166209.wav|5|But yeah, this one is uh not at all uh according to my styles, but you know, it is what it is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_169861_174629.wav|5|Yeah, that one is it's better, but that one is just for paper because it's close to the desk.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_189988_196486.wav|5|I mean, the thing is that I wanted to put it more here, but I really like this space because ah sometimes I do stretching or yoga.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_196712_204426.wav|5|So basically, this space was more uh thought for that, like ah in the sense of actually using it like having a more wide space.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_204665_212830.wav|5|Also, sometimes ah my nephews come and so we can play a little bit and you know, this kind of things. It's it's cool. We can put a blanket or
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_213129_215756.wav|5|uh you know, a carpet and just they can play here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_222460_225693.wav|5|But maybe since you are saying, I could actually flip it this way.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_225972_230962.wav|5|So I could actually put the desk facing the... the picture.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_236004_247913.wav|5|Yeah, they are really, really expensive paints. Ah I mean ah, not that I'm bragging, but you know, eh it was ah, it's super, super um exquisite art that I have here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_248195_251281.wav|5|I mean, all of them, they are from different ah painters.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_251600_259181.wav|5|But um though my favorite one is this one, because it's ah a really, really nice landscape that I really appreciate.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_259364_262193.wav|5|Ah this landscape is from um...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_265885_276565.wav|5|Yeah, so it's really, really nice. I really like it. And the way that the light shade the the light ah goes on on top of the ah of the stones is really nice, I I really
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_282005_295476.wav|5|it's really nice. The rest, I mean, ah they are ah from other artists. In this one, ah what I really appreciate is the shades, because ah I mean, all the animals, the details, and you can e- actually see the strokes on each painting. So it's really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_295722_299423.wav|5|I really, really like also, I mean, it has a strange perspective.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_299702_301945.wav|5|And I I really appreciate that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_302231_311311.wav|5|And from that one, I think it's more of ah what you can see in the details, because ah as you can see, all the the things on the roof are the interesting thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_311607_322666.wav|5|And you might not have this in a lot of paintings, because normally you would see the floor. And I really, really think that this one is nice because of that, because it has a different angle.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_326060_328803.wav|5|Yeah, that's true. That's true. You're you're totally right.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_331472_336096.wav|5|Maybe I should move it to the bedroom and then bring... ah the other one in the bedroom is ah blue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_336414_339197.wav|5|So I think it would make a little bit more of con- contrast.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_343769_359769.wav|5|Yeah, actually... actually it is. Eh it it it makes a really nice cont- contrast and I think it's really nice because it's the center of attention of this whole part here because I have the furniture here and then the paint on top. It's really nice I think it makes a focal area.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_361795_372368.wav|5|But maybe I should remove this one or actually move this one on top of the of the fire and then I would have two focal points and maybe I could put this too in the in the bedroom.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_377077_384571.wav|5|I mean ah, sometimes I I do combine them because I work a lot uh with computational um analysis.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_384815_389263.wav|5|So then I pair them up and I just use them for having more more computational power.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_390572_398177.wav|5|And of course, sometimes like I tri- I go on a trip and then I need just to take my ah laptop and then not the PC one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_405226_409324.wav|5|Ah no, it's because uh before you came, uh I was just checking on some files that I got.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_409554_415703.wav|5|So, ah but it was just because of that. No, no, no, I don't store it here. I normally would put it on the desk.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_16703_19584.wav|5|Oh, yes, you know, it was really expensive property.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_19846_25021.wav|5|But as you can see, I have a a green, uh you know, forest view. So I really appreciated that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_25267_35587.wav|5|That is really important for me when I was... just talking to the person who just offered me this apartment, I was really, that was one of my real uh priorities.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_38070_41578.wav|5|Yeah, it's really nice. I think it gives the touch to the room, really.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_42865_47960.wav|5|And as you can see, I have a lot of paintings. I mean, this, of course, is a Van Gogh original.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_48544_56948.wav|5|Hundred percent. It was super... costly, but I wanted to actually show off this one because I think it's it's it's marvelous.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_57667_60933.wav|5|And the rest, I am not really aware.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_61104_81474.wav|5|who the painters are? But... I mean this one... this one was like five thousand... dollars if I recall well... or more I'm not sure. And this one eh was a gift but also you know I have a really really rich friend so they ga- they gift me this for my thirtieth birthday.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_84070_88818.wav|5|And eh if you can see the the figure there, it's ah green marble.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_89417_93229.wav|5|And it's so, so expensive that you cannot imagine.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_93349_96741.wav|5|I mean, it's it's maybe worth the whole apartment here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_101871_106229.wav|5|Yeah, of course. So I I think ah that that really, really matches.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_108742_111328.wav|5|Ah I mean, in winter, maybe sometimes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_117758_126609.wav|5|And the couches, ah as you can see, it's really giving this ah luxurious look, because, I mean, they are in this ah velvet.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_126836_133904.wav|5|Ah I especially asked them to be like this, because I really like the soft touch, uh and and I really enjoy it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_134137_138143.wav|5|But ah yeah, I mean, uh also that sculpture there that you can see.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_138754_141297.wav|5|Yeah, it's uh a really unique... piece.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_141589_148565.wav|5|Eh I just sent it to be done for me, especially... because I really like eh this kind of sculptures.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_148831_161459.wav|5|And ah it's ahm... it actually means the empowerment of uh of young ladies as me, you know, like rich and uh and independent women.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_165064_169381.wav|5|And uh yeah, I mean, I just keep eh books like, and things to read.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_169828_174164.wav|5|Uh not because I read much, but just because I like to pretend that I read.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_177241_181806.wav|5|No, I mean, Sherlock Holmes is not even a genre that I like.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_182279_185844.wav|5|No, I don't read, but you know, it's good to pretend that you read.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_188278_190702.wav|5|Uh no, that's also something I like to pretend.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_191247_195469.wav|5|But ah yeah, my ex-boyfriend used to play, so I think he left it and you know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_195734_199643.wav|5|I mean, in between you and me, we know each other, so I can be totally honest with you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_199951_208586.wav|5|But sometimes, you know, there are some people coming over, and then I like to, you know, I like them to think that that I am into this kind of stuff.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_210240_213036.wav|5|It's a little bit, you know, here and there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_213495_215899.wav|5|And this lamp is really, really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_217911_222493.wav|5|It was a sale, but it's so expensive that it was even not a sa- sale price.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_222686_225679.wav|5|Think it was ten thousand dollars, but it's really exclusive.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_225815_230546.wav|5|It was even more expensive than the painting. I think I might change this one because it's not expensive enough.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_236169_238190.wav|5|Yeah but maybe it's not expensive enough.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_244966_264774.wav|5|Yeah yeah because I think everything is so costly then, then maybe it doesn't look that... you know it d- doesn't match. And this is a original Persian uh carpet. I went to Iran especially to pick it because I really... I I wanted to have an original one and you know you have uh resellers here but
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_265378_270396.wav|5|Eh you can never be sure that it's actually one, that it's original.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_270634_274087.wav|5|So I just wanted to make sure that it's actual original one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_274295_278411.wav|5|So then I went to pick it up and actually to match the colors and and and to...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_278658_284272.wav|5|And as you can see, there are some hints of green, there, and in the in the figures.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_284560_290460.wav|5|And then that's why I order... for the room to be pain- painted green, because uh I wanted to make a contrast.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_295132_317216.wav|5|Uh yeah, I mean that one the service left it because they were just unpacking. And you know, um I don't do this for myself. So you came a little bit early, but uh yeah, they were just unpacking things and they were asking me ah yeah, where do we put this in there? You know, it's so exhausting even though they do it for me I I need to be just saying like yeah, put it here put it there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_323345_334612.wav|5|I mean, eh those bins... are specifically designed... for... um... cans and bottles, because I I was planning to have uh guests here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_336595_341405.wav|5|The one for cans is blue one, and the one for bottles is the red one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_341744_345479.wav|5|I wanted to to make a little bit... eh of a difference.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_349799_356595.wav|5|Ah let's see how it works when I have eh more guests, you know, because I would like to organize parties, of course.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_356897_359080.wav|5|Ah... Maybe this is...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_366205_369526.wav|5|But uh yeah, maybe maybe I have uh the
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_375914_381116.wav|5|Hundred percent.  Yeah, I could remove the table and the carpet because if some of them just...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_381849_384146.wav|5|Put something on the carpet I will just kill them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_401789_405331.wav|5|Ah ah you mean this one or the one with the... with the computer?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_408589_415836.wav|5|I mean, the one with the computer, it was... I was just checking uh some things on the computer and I just put it there, but uh it's a really expensive one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_419567_422389.wav|5|It's really, really a special edition.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_422954_426928.wav|5|So uh I think uh I would keep that one. The other one, yes, you're right.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_427124_431054.wav|5|But I might put the statue in on top of that really expensive one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_431887_435043.wav|5|Because eh, yeah, uh I think it is it is nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_436187_441073.wav|5|Yeah, yeah, but that one yeah, I can just... If you want it you can take it with you, really.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_443029_446468.wav|5|I mean it is expensive but not as expensive as as it should
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_455281_461289.wav|5|Yeah, the TV it's uh... I mean eh I think it's not big enough. I might get a bigger one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_462613_470264.wav|5|Yeah, or maybe a projector, because I sometimes like to do movie night and then it's not, I think it's not enough.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_486033_488050.wav|5|Yeah, maybe I can do some rearranging.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_488222_491542.wav|5|And then... now, of course, the Bangkok is not going anywhere.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_496616_500575.wav|5|I mean, yeah, you have this kind of problems, but ta- take the table, take the table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_19591_22161.wav|6|Bit closer or I don't know, here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_23002_25671.wav|6|Ok, yeah that's a very nice apartment you have here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_68797_71055.wav|6|That's cool, everything looks so expensive.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_134905_138840.wav|6|How about this really cute little animal? What is that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_167282_169467.wav|6|And the other one, this little... little guy here?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_208637_211593.wav|6|Which one is your favorite from these... these two animals?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_246638_249074.wav|6|That's why you have this statue here? Or what was the reason?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_298647_302436.wav|6|And are those also separated this... for the feng shui, or what are those?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_319826_322645.wav|6|So how about that red? I really like that red one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_354736_357373.wav|6|It seems that it's, like this table here, you see?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_357924_362821.wav|6|I think it's a bit... There are a lot of, items there. Why do you have those... out?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_416189_418780.wav|6|Is there a reason that one of the armchair is missing a pillow?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_434686_436713.wav|6|But maybe you could place it from the sofa, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_460680_464683.wav|6|Yes, I do not have many plants here. Why is that? You can see that you have one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_521475_525095.wav|6|Why do you have, why do you have these plates out on the table?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_545230_547591.wav|6|That's a very beautiful chandelier you have there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_590119_594539.wav|6|Aha. What is your least favorite, spot here or i- item?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_610233_612752.wav|6|Yeah, I was more thinking about what do you like the least.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_639817_641964.wav|6|Mm. I also don't really like that lamp.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_667627_670618.wav|6|Yeah, that... that makes a lot of sense, I understand it. That part.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_671397_677674.wav|6|But eh yeah, but uh you also have a lot of lights on the ceiling, so like I think maybe you could remove one of the lamps, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_714630_718801.wav|6|Ah I c- thought it was the sun, yeah U- UV ray or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_740777_743430.wav|6|Oh, I didn't even see you have another plant. It looks a bit sad.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_744599_746828.wav|6|It's in between the armchairs you have that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_763946_768066.wav|6|But it seems it's missing leaves, no? Or it's intentional? Or it's like like this from default?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_39158_44470.wav|6|I think it's a bit bland. I tried to move... put some objects, but it seems a bit chaotic.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_44603_50816.wav|6|Like I look around and all objects are scattered around, like the sta- statue and all the v- vases.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_150378_152847.wav|6|Yeah, but also I'm a bit concerned with the TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_183013_185342.wav|6|And... which table should I move there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_282750_285334.wav|6|I think I like the dark one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_358574_363614.wav|6|O- one last thing I wanted to ask, my favorite statue, I want to put it somewhere where it's more clear.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_364114_366564.wav|6|Like I want to place the statue in a place
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_371169_374410.wav|6|Yes, I want to place it somewhere where it's very visible.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_420415_422812.wav|6|OK, yeah, thanks. I now have a very clear vision.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_1037_3726.wav|6|K then, I will be the...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_5001_7797.wav|6|Uh, yes, I rented out your room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_8520_12124.wav|6|Yeah, so it's been really, really nice living here for five years.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_40740_43025.wav|6|Oh no, I think everything went well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_49944_52565.wav|6|Aha, w- what how was it before? What, what has...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_55092_60498.wav|6|Ah uh it's not painting, it's just a bit of pa- paper decoration on it, I can remove it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_82690_89430.wav|6|Yes, I hang them there, but I was very careful with the uh ceiling, so it it's not it's not damaged.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_108252_110282.wav|6|Ah, uh, there's a hole, so I can remove them, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_128520_133823.wav|6|Oh, I have those still. I didn't... It it was too depressive, so I just changed them, but I have them in the wardrobe.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_147700_155090.wav|6|I also changed the, um uh pillow, cover. I did...I didn't like the color, but I can change it back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_161579_164342.wav|6|Yeah, yeah  it was the same, I think. I just changed the green one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_182804_186696.wav|6|No, I I don't like metal things, so I just put it on the kitchen, where I don't see it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_197030_205004.wav|6|Yeah. One thing I needed to change is the remote. It's ah I needed took it to... I took it to service, and I... they gave me a new one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_283452_288031.wav|6|No, I didn't really clean that painting. That seemed very expensive, so I just left it there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_305710_309691.wav|6|Ahm, yes, and about the kettle, in the back of the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_310608_313802.wav|6|Like you said ah I yeah... I had to... I painted it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_314859_317256.wav|6|It was white before, but now it's green.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_335640_337855.wav|6|I think it looks very cool with the paintings.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_356211_358403.wav|6|Yes where, where are you pointing?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_inter_383738_385762.wav|6|It's a good question. I will check on the photos.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_6902_12629.wav|6|Okay, I started it so I can be the lost rich person who doesn't know what to do with their apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_14442_17159.wav|6|So yeah, hi, I just moved here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_27646_35298.wav|6|I can't really point- pinpoint it out. I think all ob-... I have problems with multiple objects. I think... I don't like the statue situation here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_45752_48970.wav|6|recommendation for the objects, which one I should keep?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_84094_86791.wav|6|Maybe I can paint that white, the background.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_134881_137632.wav|6|I think the animals are also a bit creepy, don't you think?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_154228_158223.wav|6|Ah, I think I can live with one of the animals. Which one I should keep? I... Can you?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_197397_201518.wav|6|Okay, but I also don't really like this lamp situation. It's very too much for me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_201996_206482.wav|6|I think I would want to remove maybe lamps or the lights from above or this chandelier.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_206887_211278.wav|6|S- do you... can you like... Can we go through which one do you think is good?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_251770_256024.wav|6|It also seems like it has ten bulbs. I think that's unfortunate, I heard, no? Like, having...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_262994_265141.wav|6|Or maybe I can just remove all of the bulbs, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_279858_282101.wav|6|How w- how about any of this bulb here?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_323321_327274.wav|6|That makes sense. I also was not sure where to place the statue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_337118_339874.wav|6|Okay, so then in back, I should put the one, this golden one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_352267_355107.wav|6|And then where should I p- place my back... backstage statue?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_374261_380512.wav|6|I also don't like this sofa situation. It's very crowded. I sh-... I want to remove one item from this. Which one I should remove?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_428920_432568.wav|6|Do you think I need a different TV, maybe a bit larger? Or?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_444552_447672.wav|6|What... what do you think about the size? Like, should it be like larger? Like s-...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_466439_468508.wav|6|I s- I think I also have too many ch- chairs here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_470681_472912.wav|6|Eh... For the placements, yeah, to make it harmonic.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_501632_503692.wav|6|Okay, and where should I place my laptop?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_523891_527141.wav|6|Okay. And yeah, I have this... my favorite plant over here...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_531622_533641.wav|6|Ah... my plant.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_003_inter_573729_576245.wav|6|That's very nice. I... Thank you for your assistance.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_2250_8474.wav|6|So yeah, I think we can check my head. I think it's fine. Yeah, we'll just go back the same spot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_9975_11986.wav|6|Can you put a t-pose eh? Yeah, thanks.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_22613_26161.wav|6|But uh I don't really like it now. So can you help with some advice?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_155769_158111.wav|6|What do you think about the placement of the table?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_173005_175260.wav|6|Ah, but yeah, I meant the other table, which...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_229118_231560.wav|6|I think I was... I was thinking of moving it to the other furniture.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_232658_235527.wav|6|Like, yeah I think by the statues.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_273882_280304.wav|6|About the statues, I have to remove one of them because I'm... I want to give it to a friend... the birthday. Which one should I keep?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_302234_307505.wav|6|One other thing I don't like is the, bin placement. I think both of them are a bit...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_345937_350917.wav|6|And I think I'm a bit crowded by all these paintings, so I want to remove at least two of them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_396366_407807.wav|6|OK. Yeah, I think that makes sense. And uh I think the last question I have, I don't like this. I think it seems disorganized, keeping my newspaper here. So like where should I put?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_426916_429212.wav|6|Okay, so I guess put it on next to the armchair?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_442909_446499.wav|6|Okay, now I think I have a clear picture. Thank you for your assistance.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_1006_3159.wav|6|But uh yeah, I think the next one could be...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_3678_5823.wav|6|Maybe you can put in a t-pose?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_7847_16696.wav|6|That's yeah, that's good. Thank you, and I will come back to the room and then we can do a landlord. So in this one, it can be that ah,

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_34365_40151.wav|6|Nah, I I'm I'm just moving out and yeah maybe you are the landlord and then you are just inquiring about stuff
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_40826_43118.wav|6|Okay, but ah we can like start, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_89179_91550.wav|6|Yeah, actually I misplaced the statues.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_133489_135521.wav|6|Ah, yeah, I also moved it a bit.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_155258_157311.wav|6|Actually, I was wondering about the pillow.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_160337_162489.wav|6|Like, uh where did you buy that? the...

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_191267_195892.wav|6|I'm also wondering if I can take the... the mm bin the rubbish bin with me?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_196156_200873.wav|6|Because I I think I'm... I'm... I think I bought that one, I can't remember now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_228021_230698.wav|6|Yeah, of course, I could pay like forty kroners.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_247731_255121.wav|6|Maybe I could take the other one then, the w- one next to the ch- the th- desktop computer. Yeah. Is it also designer one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_263515_267247.wav|6|I want to put my plant in that when I'm moving it. It's very sensitive.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_298674_301351.wav|6|Ah, I also put this grey decoration on the lamp.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_inter_301728_304287.wav|6|Do you... eh though I was wondering if I should remove that, or?

data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_18748_26683.wav|6|Okay, so yeah, I just bought this new apartment and that's why I called you. I don't really... feel it's my own yet.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_48120_50657.wav|6|Bi- ch- w- wi- je- Ah ok.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_63662_65980.wav|6|You like the one here better? The small one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_98585_101949.wav|6|But I also really like the.. like this like um the color of the pillows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_102364_106681.wav|6|I think I want to replicate that somewhere in the room. Do you any idea how could I do that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_166687_169105.wav|6|You, you mean this armchair, I should move back? Or?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_221374_225377.wav|6|I was about to ask about the statues because I like both of them kin-... a lot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_257721_269360.wav|6|Um. Okay, and ah yeah, my last question was about, I really like the corner there, but I'm I'm not sure if it... it feels a bit um separated. I don't know if it's a good thing from the whole room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_309018_315256.wav|6|I... I'm not sure if I... do not enjoy suffering while I'm writing, so I will reconsider that, but that's a good idea.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_002_inter_317887_322598.wav|6|OK. Yeah. But ah yeah, I think thanks a lot. That uh that has been very useful.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_3403_7727.wav|6|Okay, so I w- I think I will also stand in this in this one here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_8959_12299.wav|6|Okay, yeah, it's uh very nice, the new place you have here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_132823_135353.wav|6|Did you make all these art pieces here? It's from you?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_244094_246352.wav|6|Yeah, yeah. That's a nice painting all over.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_303424_307950.wav|6|Yeah, but yeah, but this... this nice... Yeah, it's a bit short for me, this table. But very nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_315369_317470.wav|6|I think I'm just... You're watching this room?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_409333_411421.wav|6|The red... Red o-... Sorry, the red card?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_422085_424793.wav|6|I thought it was a credit card. Why do you keep it there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_459544_462996.wav|6|Yeah, to be honest, what I really don't like is the bin in this room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_488501_491035.wav|6|Maybe in the place of the boxes, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_513018_515211.wav|6|Yes, I, I me neither.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_515575_518606.wav|6|Okay, but that's been... I enjoyed this tour a lot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_16061_18635.wav|6|Okay, so I'm also in in one piece here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_24017_27213.wav|6|Yeah, that's like a free avatar which looks like a human.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_28610_31438.wav|6|You look like a ghost.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_32268_37703.wav|6|But it's like, yeah, I will try, but I think you're actually recording the facial expressions. That's... that's...
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_49355_52935.wav|6|So yeah. Hi. It's like it looks like a very nice place you have here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_57607_59868.wav|6|I think it's better not to walk that much in this one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_66675_71606.wav|6|Yeah, like pointing and then describing, that that would be very good to have those, like the blue bin and something like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_135987_140054.wav|6|And how do you get it? That's like... Is there someone brings you the newspaper every day? Or?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_189369_192113.wav|6|Yeah, it seems not so comfortable. And a bitty bit bland, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_212052_214257.wav|6|But yeah, it's... So you're a collector?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_297398_299557.wav|6|Yes, there's a life outside the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_299972_302555.wav|6|And how about these statues you have here? What are these?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_304057_306540.wav|6|The statues, or these art pieces. Like...
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_405637_407961.wav|6|Yeah, that had to be cheerful.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_517082_519613.wav|6|I guess you're very familiar with that book now, by now?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_538870_545277.wav|6|Yeah, I also have that bin over there, I guess, not not for... It's not accidental that you have that blue bin there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_571575_573661.wav|6|How do you refill the watering can?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_597672_602909.wav|6|But it's it's good to be efficient, with these things. It's like also very ec- eco-friendly.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_606478_610009.wav|6|But yeah, that's been very interesting. Thank you for this tour.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_610554_613266.wav|6|Now I will leave and came back in different room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_10156_13249.wav|6|Ah... No, I think it would be better not to walk that much.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_16282_18395.wav|6|So yeah, I'm... eh I'm just standing here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_21082_25593.wav|6|I will just stand here and then I'm waiting for you to explain your nice new apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_37621_39952.wav|6|Mm. Uh. A chair? So fåtölj.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_207869_212234.wav|6|S- I see also a lot of paintings. Can you just explain a bit about your paintings?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_280505_282717.wav|6|Aha. Is it the ocean or what is that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_319800_321866.wav|6|Mhm. It's a bit in contrast with the whole room, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_321977_324080.wav|6|Like, the whole room is a bit of different style?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_393944_396574.wav|6|Yeah, I think that sounds int- like a nice idea.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_410098_414753.wav|6|Yeah uh you also don't have that much nature like any plants in the room or do you have any plants?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_inter_459245_462366.wav|6|Ah. Okay. Yeah, thanks for showing your apartment, that was very nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_286_2477.wav|6|And now I will just come in the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_4631_8637.wav|6|Let me just adjust the view so I can see that, what you're looking at a bit.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_9829_11981.wav|6|I think your hair, yeah, that looks good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_15760_19256.wav|6|May- I think in this one I will just stand on the other side somewhere here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_23459_25667.wav|6|So this is my, your new apartment now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_26023_28501.wav|6|So yeah, it's very nice that you moved here. I really like this room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_48225_53945.wav|6|Oh I think all of... I... I think I... like it. You're not proud of your new room? Or...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_67067_69940.wav|6|Ah I think it actually fits very nice with the other painting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_107254_109316.wav|6|Oh wow, that's cool. Very... very high-tech.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_109722_116759.wav|6|And, do you have uh like a favourite plant from all these? Or are they all the same? Because you seem like a really plant person.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_145433_149838.wav|6|But how can you put this one back in the room? That's... It's maybe a bit lack of light here, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_189036_194304.wav|6|I really like those.... pillows here. Is it intentional, different colors, or why.... why is that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_209012_212355.wav|6|Are you not concerned about the white one? I think it can be stained very easily.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_214497_217904.wav|6|No, just... Yeah, the, no the pillow, it seems.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_243765_247327.wav|6|But I see that you work here in the couch. It's like eh... it's like
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_259984_262999.wav|6|Are you not concerned that the laptop overheats on the couch?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_273915_277455.wav|6|Why don't you put that small table... in the... from there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_295872_298616.wav|6|But I really like that corner situation in the back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_001_inter_353457_358195.wav|6|Yeah. Yeah, I think it's very nice. Congrats on your new apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_481_4070.wav|6|Okay, so we can do the landlord stuff.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_5881_8660.wav|6|So yeah, thanks for renting me out this place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_22426_25564.wav|6|It's a bit small for me, I want a bigger apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_70950_74021.wav|6|I think I can check on the bottles. I think that they were fine.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_94440_99757.wav|6|I think that painting looks ah... no I think I moved it. I can s- s- switch it back. That's the only thing that changed.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_108802_110933.wav|6|But, yeah ah yeah, it's from IKEA, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_126857_130586.wav|6|I actually hired people, to clean it but then maybe that was not...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_133638_137394.wav|6|Yeah, I think I should go back and... ahm talk to them
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_137756_139795.wav|6|I think I will get another company.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_155885_157948.wav|6|No it's, it's not broken, I don't think so.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_168076_170943.wav|6|Yeah, but I have it just keeps falling now, it's sad.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_206826_212375.wav|6|I put it in the kitchen, in the cupboards now just to be it was very beautiful, just to make sure that it's safe.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_240701_242827.wav|6|No, I know I don't drink i- I don't...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_258410_261994.wav|6|Yeah the ah, the service people replaced it, two weeks ago.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_inter_269624_272371.wav|6|Yeah, it's in the it's an email. Maybe you missed the email, then.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_11793_13976.wav|6|Did it sound like or something or no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_17097_20603.wav|6|Yeah, so this is my new apartment. I'm... I think I need some tips how to make it more cozy.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_49798_54461.wav|6|Yeah, actually, I, uh this is like a, for me it's a c-, cozy...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_55188_59236.wav|6|like maybe isolated from the world, so I just want to reset, settle in here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_154421_157551.wav|6|Yeah, I ke- you see are all... all my stuff are there on that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_162225_164599.wav|6|Mhm. But where should I place items then?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_173927_179212.wav|6|Yeah, but actually I want to... I think I want to remove the table. So where should I put all the items from that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_203424_206616.wav|6|Where do I... Yeah ok, but where do I put the stay- statue then?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_223188_228263.wav|6|Mm... Yeah, I just s- just rest it there because I use on the couch. I don't want it to overheat.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_278760_281722.wav|6|Yeah, but actually I want to keep the Black one, the black pillow.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_304588_308582.wav|6|I'm a bit concerned about my watch. I don't want it to break.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_335230_338320.wav|6|I'm also concerned that my plant is not getting enough light.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_370286_376166.wav|6|Okay, I think that sounds good. And yeah I w- last... I think the last topic I need one to cover is the painting situation.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_413640_419571.wav|6|Yes, I think that's ah ks- ks- starting to look good in my head. I think that I don't really like the bins.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_424437_428605.wav|6|I think they are... were separate, yeah. I think I could keep one. Which one would you keep?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_450074_454851.wav|6|Yeah, and then yeah I don't I think maybe I've already mentioned that my statue is very important for me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_inter_455831_459470.wav|6|So I so I think, ehn I'm not sure if it's a good place or what do you think?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_2701_9433.wav|6|I can see you, the sound is going, so I will just come in and then, um yeah, we can start the take.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_10400_12566.wav|6|Maybe you can put on a T-pose in the beginning, that's good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_19919_23052.wav|6|Hi, it's a very nice apartment you have here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_45299_49970.wav|6|Yeah, that looks very interesting. Can you explain a bit more about those? Like, which is your favorite one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_81261_85002.wav|6|That's a very interesting sculpture. What can you tell more about that one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_88438_91652.wav|6|Ah, I g-... ah actually, I think the brown one, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_140959_144326.wav|6|I don't really get why you put the bin there. It's a bit ugly, no?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_166034_169096.wav|6|We could exchange these two, no? Like this one looks better a bit.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_185839_190010.wav|6|Ah. I think it's a strange choice to put the computer here. But...
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_217041_219505.wav|6|That's... Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_219744_222258.wav|6|And ah how about all these?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_232954_236062.wav|6|Yeah, but how about all these paintings you have? Like... kind of a lot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_322832_325597.wav|6|I think it blends a bit too much into the wall color.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_338419_343652.wav|6|Yeah, I think actually that's what I like about this one, that painting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_inter_417936_421153.wav|6|Okay, but yeah, yeah good luck with your new apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_12140_15575.wav|6|So yeah, good, a nice purchase.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_99359_101956.wav|6|But you find in... a d- really nice space for that, I think.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_174101_177547.wav|6|Ah, but is... so you don't read these books, like this one, the table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_241972_244952.wav|6|I'll... I just keep... keep the level, I think that makes sense.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_291879_294322.wav|6|I don't really understand this box here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_318919_323314.wav|6|I'm also not sure what are you going for with these bins here. What a- What are those?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_389513_395324.wav|6|Yeah, and I would... wanted to point out this this table. It doesn't look expensive, I think, here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_405366_409067.wav|6|Actually, both of them. The one... the computer, I think that's a bit too tall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_472218_478759.wav|6|think a projector sounds good, but then, I don't... does it fit here? I mean, d- with this, I think then you need to remove your van.. van gogh.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_479597_482553.wav|6|And ah I think that's that's a dilemma you have to solve.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_inter_493034_495354.wav|6|Yeah, I think I have to leave now because I actually have to work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_44609_49115.wav|3|Oh, I'm... I'm sorry that you're leaving, but ah so l- let's just check everything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_49672_61855.wav|3|So everything is like when when you came here, because I I notice there are some changes and and eh nothing happened to to anything in here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_66839_70542.wav|3|Uh, because I can see some scratches on the table there and...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_77506_81601.wav|3|because eh uh... you have a lot of stuff there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_82676_86964.wav|3|But eh otherwise, ha- has there been any problems with anything...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_100298_113460.wav|3|Yeah, yeah, I c- I couldn't see anything uh wrong with those but ah I see that there's a plant missing but ah... So maybe you forgot to water it or something... I dunno...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_114770_118045.wav|3|Uh, the one that stood to the left of that one... The hibiscus.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_125300_128014.wav|3|and uh... So uh...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_141582_147210.wav|3|Uh... Everyone has their... preferences. So um...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_147668_150598.wav|3|And now when I'm renting it out again, I'll I'll have to...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_151603_154945.wav|3|take the new uh tenant and see what they want.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_178137_183149.wav|3|You can... you can have it because ah... I don't have any real relation to that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_183332_187051.wav|3|Ah... So if you like it, ah you you can have it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_202678_209422.wav|3|Yes, of course, but but uh why would you like that one? Eh... don't you want a smaller one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_212402_227660.wav|3|Alright ah but ah because it's a designer bin, um... but... so it's not not very expensive, but eh c- could you... pay something for it?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_234733_239292.wav|3|I I said it was a designer thing. That... that's actually... two thousand crowns.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_277019_279065.wav|3|But I ha- I had two plants, didn't I?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_280866_283094.wav|3|I had a hibiscus and that one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_285221_296831.wav|3|Oh, I can't remember. And I al- always think that I should take pictures of wh- what I leave here, but I'll I'll do that next time. But... of course, if you say it's it's yours... uh ff take it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_306725_312424.wav|3|I hope so, because that's a very important lamp to me. So... so uh,
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_314787_316928.wav|3|Yes, you have to remove that, and...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_317235_321535.wav|3|because that lamp is eh f- from my grandmother and I...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_325288_327866.wav|3|Lucky you told me because oh if if if if
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_329131_334098.wav|3|Okay, but have you glued it on, or is it eh just put l- like...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_335274_350222.wav|3|Ah, okay, thank God for that, because... uh... it would be really, really sad if that lamp got uh ff damaged in any way, so. Okay, so y- yes, I would like to to remove that, of course.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_358414_360634.wav|3|Uh... So... um...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_13899_18173.wav|3|Oh, it's attached to the computer. Okay, great. So I don't destroy anything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_19564_24725.wav|3|Okay, so eh I understand why you brought me here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_26222_39084.wav|3|Eh... There are a lot of things that needs to be done here. But w- w- w- what did you have in mind? W- what's your... what turns you on like designer wise?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_50183_60646.wav|3|Yes, and and now you have like the the the desk there. Why why do you have a desk in this beautiful room? And and why do you have the sofa?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_61633_67530.wav|3|C- could I be frank and and just say directly what we should get rid of?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_68754_73905.wav|3|The desk, you you can't have that here because it's eh ruining the whole atmosphere.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_75604_78292.wav|3|Yeah. And, and have you heard of Feng Shui?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_79586_103065.wav|3|Yes. So uh be- because that's South and that's North. And, and you never ever want to have your back, uh this way because you know, ff someone could come in and murder you or cut your throat or an- anything. So you really want to have the couch so that your...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_105179_131818.wav|3|safe so you can see if something... and of course, eh wh- what I think would be nice is that because you you have that fireplace there and and do does it work? It does! Because then I think you should maybe if we could get rid of the sofa and the armchair and get something that was...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_133361_149936.wav|3|eh like, a whole couch, that uh sits together, or, maybe, we could also, place the sofa between...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_153466_157182.wav|3|Yes, d- do you watch TV a lot
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_160161_169329.wav|3|Because w- what I thought w- would be nice, because you can actually do two, two areas in this room because it's so big.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_169877_183623.wav|3|So w- what you could do is have like, uh you could have a sofa over there and a table and maybe two armchairs where you entertain guests and then
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_187244_189346.wav|3|I don't know, that's a bit heavy, I think.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_189346_198879.wav|3|Eh I think you should need something that... be- be- I I'm not really into those things where you can put things underneath them, because y- you just collect dust.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_208037_215952.wav|3|Eh I I thought we agreed on that you would take that out, because you do you have a- another room you can have it in?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_216841_228383.wav|3|Yeah, be- because it's eh you should never work-... this should be a place for you to eh contemplate and and have silence, and...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_228996_235934.wav|3|But now you want the TV eh and you have the laptop, of course, so so you don't really need a working place like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_236638_264166.wav|3|So, I I would suggest that you, we put, we we could actually use this sofa over there, and then maybe some more plants, bigger plants, and and a a a a bigger um lamp, and pff if we could, oh these are all right, but y- y- it would be nice to have a chandelier or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_271145_275956.wav|3|Yeah, I'm glad you say that because it is too much. It's really too much.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_280147_282873.wav|3|Do do you have a favorite of these ones?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_285075_304176.wav|3|Yeah, me too, because it's, eh so if if you could have that, bi- be- be- eh that one, the dark one, if you put that above the fireplace, and then you have the sofa over there, so you can sit and and watch this beautiful eh scenery you have outside.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_304916_309158.wav|3|What we also could do is like turning,
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_310052_328647.wav|3|These two, if y- if you want to, li- like a place where w- w- we build something, where you can sit and read, read a book or something, just look outs- uh out the window or anything, because these these are beautiful and you really don't use it for anything, just putting that th- thing over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_329145_342026.wav|3|So I I really think you could have like a contemplation area there eh and an entertaining area where you entertain guests. And here you could have a small, t- may- maybe two armchairs.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_342837_352550.wav|3|So you can sit with your, do you have a boyfriend or uh s- s- so you could sit there and watch the fireplace and of course the painting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_355114_357974.wav|3|you it's it's great. Uh do you live with your boyfriend?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_375285_383945.wav|3|where it's visible, I I think you should put it there. If if we... w- we we could have like a pedestal up or make a...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_385220_388408.wav|3|It would be nice. W- what material is it? Is is it bronze?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_391999_396579.wav|3|No uh yes... And it has the the foot there. So maybe have...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_400614_411661.wav|3|What I think would be nice is to have a glass shelf so that you don't eh... It looks like it's floating in the air.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_414347_417934.wav|3|And then you can see it immediately and and em...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_main_423868_428095.wav|3|And of course I can send you a a blueprint and and make a sketch of it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_62376_74922.wav|3|God, it's strange to... It's really strange because when you can't see it, you feel it, but you can't see it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_88110_94120.wav|3|But, uh, as you know, we, we agreed on six months.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_94420_96464.wav|3|So, so I wonder why you're leaving earlier.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_100992_105866.wav|3|And normally, I, I would have to charge you for the whole time.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_106712_109752.wav|3|But I think I can make an exception because
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_114382_123266.wav|3|But is it anything you think of that that I could improve here for the next person?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_131489_135531.wav|3|Oh, so you think it was too much to take care of?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_146217_149902.wav|3|because one thing is that they're all air cleaners.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_152972_161361.wav|3|But, uh, I understand that it could be some difficulties actually to, to water those up there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_163642_167484.wav|3|Would it be all right if I put a ladder in or something?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_177940_184603.wav|3|yeah it's taking a lot of space yeah so yeah i understand that and it's just a yucca palm so
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_192145_198292.wav|3|yeah i could agree on that so maybe if i just swap places with those two
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_226352_229679.wav|3|And you, you have thought of this now when you're moving out?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_237186_239448.wav|3|But, what, what would you prefer?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_242351_246896.wav|3|Would you have liked to, to put up something of your own?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_260223_267258.wav|3|so because i don't want to put, to have a lot of holes in the walls and but i could put up whatever they call again
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_299161_307461.wav|3|you could have the sofa like that, but you don't want to have, you want to have the back, you want to have a wall behind you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_309110_318477.wav|3|Yeah, I don't think of that, because I, I realize now, I haven't never thought of it, that there's actually not much.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_319038_321340.wav|3|This is like, uh, an empty space.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_328766_332268.wav|3|Now maybe I, I'll have to, to rethink the whole room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_340590_347719.wav|3|Now when you, when, when you're pointing, pointing, pointing it out to me, I, it really feels, uh,  difficult.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_348222_351472.wav|3|And why did I put that bin over there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_363746_373174.wav|3|It looks like, eh, if, like you're having orgies with candies and you have to throw papers and, uh,  soda cans there, but
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_375673_378194.wav|3|My God, I've never thought of that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_398705_402506.wav|3|Yes, and, and you write, you're not a digital writer, you write on paper.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_412615_414875.wav|3|Or is it, yes, it's PC.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_420634_428025.wav|3|So, no, but I really enjoyed the tapes and, and there has been no complaints from the neighbors.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_429343_431437.wav|3|So I'm really happy with you here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_440005_452868.wav|3|and the PC of course and is it your watch the one on on  the in front of the tv yeah of course
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_463813_473936.wav|3|ah yeah yeah of course i thought you meant that one but that's mine yeah of course you take the what's yours yeah
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_110838_114316.wav|3|I really have some other persons who want it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_206047_218163.wav|3|yeah,  i can understand that because you don't want to sit like this and especially if you lie down on the couch you you want to have it lower so i can see that so thank you that's a great suggestion
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_199545_202634.wav|3|i take the bureau from there and put it there
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_234115_236684.wav|3| if you had told me we, we could have removed some of them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_252699_258287.wav|3|because maybe i should get something like you know they have in galleries instead like
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_276770_279200.wav|3|I don't know actually i just haven't
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_002_main_435451_438663.wav|3|yes of course and don't forget your credit card a
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_7839_10662.wav|3|Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_11883_14673.wav|3|What I suggest is, uh
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_20490_31019.wav|3|So what I suggest that we do is to, before we start thinking of what you want, we have to take everything out.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_35273_39442.wav|3|It's big, but, uh, I think it would be good because
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_63645_67712.wav|3|This doesn't go with the earth colors here and it doesn't go with the
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_67911_71071.wav|3|The only thing it goes with is that blanket and the
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_77560_81063.wav|3|Yeah, if you should replace one thing, it should be this one, the armchair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_83556_93312.wav|3|And maybe, if, because what what we can do, I don't mean that you just should, uh, throw things out.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_97082_99741.wav|3|I don't mean that you should throw things out.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_100444_105506.wav|3|I mean that we sell it because I, I can see that this is not an IKEA armchair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_105546_108127.wav|3|It's was quite expensive.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_112328_114690.wav|3|Yes, you keep the big sofa then.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_115210_117453.wav|3|Yeah, because this one I think should go.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_122461_124601.wav|3|Okay, okay, but then
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_127534_130310.wav|3|Is it something else in here you really want to keep?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_138450_153720.wav|3|Yeah, because what I think is that we could, uh, do, because this is a bit modern, and what we could do is go with the more of a mixed feeling, so that it becomes more timeless.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_154366_160564.wav|3|And I really would like to, to, uh, change the carpet, if it's alright.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_161584_166435.wav|3|Because it is too, it, it takes all your attention when you comes in here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_173673_177075.wav|3|And would it be alright for you to have a lot of space?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_179237_182325.wav|3|Because it's really nice to, to have this much space
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_191368_195812.wav|3|what we could do is to look for if we could find more of this armchair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_218449_221171.wav|3| so it's all right to bring a computer but not have a computer.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_222251_232282.wav|3|what you could do, when you say it like that, you could make this an amazing room if we, like for instance, have this one
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_240103_250221.wav|3|chair or you don't have any sofa or anything and we just just have things like that little cushion there or even, uh,  the sack of bags
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_256101_258725.wav|3|sit, lie down, whatever you want to.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_258904_265834.wav|3|That would be really nice because this is such a great room and if you just stand in this direction
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_270520_274763.wav|3|So would it be alright for you to take away the paintings?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_277073_279554.wav|3|All the paintings, the flower one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_288270_298379.wav|3|And then you could have, because I see you,  you enjoy artwork, uh, because then we could put the artworks and maybe find a
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_304574_313525.wav|3|put them out in the room like if they are living here like if they're taking a walk in the park it would be really nice
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_325022_337632.wav|3|because I like that one because he's I don't know if it's a towel she has in her hand or if it is a towel yeah, eh,  it looks like she's going to the beach so
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_339901_344877.wav|3|Yeah, so we could have her walking in that direction
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_352022_355199.wav|3|I really like it now we're talking.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_355719_358543.wav|3|I really like that you're open to get rid of things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_362123_368024.wav|3|you don't need a remote control as you I understood it that you didn't want television
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_380200_385523.wav|3|So this could be really, we, we should do something about those plants in the ceiling.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_386978_391239.wav|3|Because now you have, uh, I don't know what that is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_395638_397858.wav|3|It's called parrot something in Swedish.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_398364_403646.wav|3|And those are small monsteras, but you should have something that was big,
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_404486_414911.wav|3|Because I like the idea of something coming from the above, but you should have something that creates a waterfall of, uh, flowers, like...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_442690_446768.wav|3|is to cover those holes and make new ones.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_451332_459295.wav|3|wherever we, we place the armchair, we could create like a triangle above this one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_459375_464858.wav|3|So one is functioning as a, uh, reading lamp or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_476757_487062.wav|3|yes so i think you should it depends on where we put the armchair because as i said i would like to take everything out but if i just close my eyes
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_496980_519133.wav|3|and there's the middle of the room but you don't want to would it be all right for you if we change the direction of the door so that it went that way when you open it instead of this way because then you could save a lot more of the room because i was thinking of putting this armchair there but you don't want the door to go
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_519664_528568.wav|3|like that because then you ruin the idea but if you open this way it the door doesn't interfere with the armchair
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_542173_549117.wav|3|yes remove the flower and put the armchair there because, uh, it is an, eh
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_561746_578877.wav|3|flower like it doesn't look, uh, at first i thought it looked like a spider's web or something but now now i think more it looks like a flower a lotus flower so i think you could have it over there and then just place cushions all around it and and then we of course
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_581570_594469.wav|3|change the position of the we, we change the carpet and try to find a bigger carpet that goes more in the entire room, uh,  so that you can use it and we get rid of the cupboards
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_16328_19045.wav|3|I think we should look at the room as a canvas.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_42850_52308.wav|3|I don't know what what your budget is, but could you, uh, think of buying a new sofa?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_58663_63121.wav|3|what color scheme we have, because now it's just, it's, we have
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_213033_215362.wav|3|peace, peaceful, no television, no...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_236165_238648.wav|3|and that's the only
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_251987_254793.wav|3|around so you can have sit
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_283002_288168.wav|3|it has something meditative over it, but the other ones we could leave.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_301656_303999.wav|3|and find more of those and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_345767_351645.wav|3| and maybe find some more stuff in various sizes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_371992_375686.wav|3|wherever you put the TV you put the remote control it's no problem
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_488863_495729.wav|3|i close my eyes and there's the door and and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_531585_535729.wav|3| if we have the armchair here we could put that little armchair by the window
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_537105_541044.wav|3|we could put that one by the window and then
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_003_main_549904_557927.wav|3|adult armchair even if it looks like a child it looks like something you can sit and meditate on and relax and i like that
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_36761_54301.wav|3|Yes, I think that eh when when you look at it eh because you have this wonderful window here and this one and eh I think that this is a good placement of the sofa because you can
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_55906_78277.wav|3|See outside, but I really think you should have That we should make something here eh like a place where you could sit and relax so it could be a cushion all the way there and and then you could Yes, but
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_79855_82458.wav|3|when when you have this view.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_85087_87207.wav|3|eh the sofa is more for television.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_95627_104046.wav|3|I think I think maybe you could do something like, since it is an old factory, if we made
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_112893_118455.wav|3|But I I think you should have something that was about this high, 20 centimeters.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_119956_123002.wav|3|And then a thick cushion.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_129591_139804.wav|3|depends on if we if we like that one the pink one the light one but that depends and then of course
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_162597_165520.wav|3|yes if we can we would
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_189282_193206.wav|3|I suggest we look into that and just tear that wall down.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_195455_201212.wav|3|I really think that those two paintings eh work well next to each other.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_201929_210765.wav|3|So we could, eh, let's see now, because now, now we're, oh, you will have a great room in here. You will have
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_218700_245027.wav|3|we have to move that one of course but and I'm not too fond of the shelf, eh, maybe you could get another one so we tear this down and then I just have to check what direction you should have for that you enter there and that's the bedroom in there yes
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_247549_251049.wav|3|and that's the kitchen so you come from
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_275982_278204.wav|3|Cabinet I've done this for another client.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_278663_291656.wav|3|So we build a cabinet and then we fix a remote control So that the television when you don't look at it, it goes down So it's only up when you watch television
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_306471_311628.wav|3|Because now now I have to go away from the idea of tearing this wall down because it's...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_324910_332891.wav|3|or what we could do is if we open up then you could have your vases there if it's broad enough
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_354195_359247.wav|3|You want to have the sofa here or if you want to keep this sofa, we could have another sofa.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_362279_382285.wav|3|Yeah, but I don't think we can do so much about the angle because then you you have to make a choice whether you want to see the TV or because the best way that I would prefer is to have the sofa over there by the wall and to really enjoy this view.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_384379_398899.wav|3|And then of course what we should have to do You know there's a new technique now where you put a screen there are special windows
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_399880_421798.wav|3|that they're like this, but when you Use a remote they are frosted so you can't see inside Because it's really you can't have much privacy in here if you invite Your boyfriend or anything and you want to cuddle or something so then you can just if you want to see and have privacy and feel
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_424060_439177.wav|3|even if you're alone it can be so I either use that frosting or create a curtain here where that's also handled by remote control to like a cinema curtain that goes
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_454542_469538.wav|3|Yeah, so what, let's see, because what if we, hmm, we actually have to, what?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_471061_494799.wav|3|where do we put the television if we put the couch over there, hmm,  because it's so much whe-where it depends on because okay let's remove that one but then uh the shelf with the artwork and then but those paintings are so nice so you you want to have them i thought of putting the
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_541490_547836.wav|3|Yes, but, uh,  what what we could do is to place a pot or something
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_574518_579900.wav|3|So we we  we could get something that looks a bit exclusive.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_584473_612951.wav|3|I think because you have the light and the sun comes up there so I think you should put both plants there because then that one to there because then they get the morning light and then when the sun comes in in the afternoon it doesn't get too hot for them so they get enough light anyway, uh,  yeah great thank you yes
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_108856_111799.wav|3|We could make it like to look like boxes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_143131_154431.wav|3| it's such a nice room and then you of course you have this room as well so if we if you could you in some way
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_154627_159429.wav|3|do you know if the wall is a bearing wall
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_171467_174538.wav|3|yeah of course you can move them anywhere you can have
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_178291_185386.wav|3|yes it has to move move place but it does doesn't have to go if it means a lot to you because what you
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_254642_261928.wav|3|No you can't have the sofa there no no maybe we should move the sofa there uh my god
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_271620_274716.wav|3|eeh uh like um
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_263307_270974.wav|3|i really don't know what to do with the tele oh do you know what we do i have an idea we build
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_294362_301622.wav|3|So we we might get a bigger or you you could have a big one, so it's like a cinema and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_314563_316995.wav|3|Maybe we just open open up
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_319162_324330.wav|3|above and just eeh put windows there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_333041_342137.wav|3|so yeah that's great because i really think that if we we can't move around we can't move you can't have a sofa there as your
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_342885_352314.wav|3|bedroom door is going this way yes so and we don't want to sit in that direction anyway but you want to have this one as eh
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_507715_521747.wav|3| that one that you put, uh, next to that one and the sofa underneath but where do we put, uh, could you think of, uh, getting another lamp because that takes a lot of space actually
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_525970_529721.wav|3|We could put  small lights in the ceiling.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_550406_553211.wav|3|But that you could, do you want it in here or
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_561162_563546.wav|3|Then we could get a, uh, little bowl or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_003_main_563726_566129.wav|3|then you could have, because you have a lot of keys.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_36434_43193.wav|3|Yes I did actually and and I was so so lucky because you know
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_57488_68274.wav|3|So, what we did, and it's a rental, eh, but you know, you have to pay a lot of black money for for a place like this. but
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_73731_76680.wav|3|So what I think is that this was actually
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_82575_89701.wav|3|So, eh,  like this window, it's windows all the way up to the fourth floor.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_90061_95504.wav|3|And that was actually, eh, there was no floor here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_96087_99790.wav|3|So that's, they they put that in later on.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_99890_109279.wav|3|So, so it was actually just four, uh, floors, uh and they had to make the floors.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_109419_115638.wav|3|So there was a big, uh, newspaper here and they had the, the, the
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_120358_122424.wav|3|The, the machine that produced the paper.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_122709_126344.wav|3|So it was standing somewhere in the middle of the room and it was flying around.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_132542_135449.wav|3|But so, so, these are actually,
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_137139_141877.wav|3|like they have built walls and and made, uh, apartments in this building.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_142443_148935.wav|3|So it's, and that's why the rooms, you, you can see there are no windows in that direction.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_151130_159720.wav|3|And that's because, uh, I have rooms there, but, uh, the windows is in the apartment, the next apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_160397_163697.wav|3|So there is only this window and this one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_175757_187200.wav|3|It was a, uh,  designer group called the Cubists, uh, where an artist called Olle Bonnier was one of the. uh,  guys in this group.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_189403_194012.wav|3|And do you think of anything when when you see the fabric, when you see the pattern?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_197031_200417.wav|3|Yes, but do you think of an instrument of some kind?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_203400_213651.wav|3|No, but if you think of... Yes, you see that it's... uh, so, so that's actually the piano keys, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_214689_217214.wav|3|And, eh, it's, eh, really nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_235458_241062.wav|3|And I could have placed the white one in the middle, but I .. I didn't.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_243307_259994.wav|3|When I was a child there was a candy called, uh,  nickel and it had various little candies and there was always two purple ones that was, uh, called viol and then there was a mint one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_262212_271021.wav|3|which was mint, and, uhm yes, of course, there were more vanilla and stuff like that, but, huh,  I had room for three pillows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_271054_284624.wav|3|So that's why they go away from the pattern, because I, I,  agree that, and and  you wouldn't have the the cushions like that, but you you can just do whatever you want with them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_284669_288029.wav|3|And so if you want to rest your head, you lift it up.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_295722_307301.wav|3|because I really think, as you already pointed out, there, there are, you see there are not many colors here, the, the roof, the ceiling is quite dark and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_318068_322729.wav|3|boring actually because you know, I wanted it to be
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_325550_328733.wav|3|I wanted the room to describe me as a person.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_329192_343965.wav|3|I'm structured if you can't think that when I just throw my phone and things like that, but I'm, I'm very structured and But I have a very vivid fantasy
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_344750_350862.wav|3|And that's also because I don't know what you think about that paper bin because it's really big.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_351903_354431.wav|3|Yes, but that's actually a piece of art.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_356193_361789.wav|3|Because it's an artist called, uh, David Dina., Davidina.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_362537_366902.wav|3|She's a Russian artist eh and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_385330_388309.wav|3|by, by other people, Other people fill your void.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_389065_399660.wav|3|So, so every time someone comes in here it's supposed that they, a part of them goes into the bin and then you have them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_436340_465061.wav|3|Yes it is and it's made of a material, uh,  that is recycled from, uh,  corn, uhm  so it's not the material isn't worth anything but, uh, the, the artist it's just worth something because the artist made it otherwise the material is just you, you, costs two kronors or something and then of course it's the tiger up there
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_465922_480181.wav|3|no it's a cheetah, ah, yes it's a cheetah and, uh, that one is from, uh,  india and, uh, it's really
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_511409_516005.wav|3|Oh, that's also it's as you can see, it's, uh,  a fantasy world.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_518387_523777.wav|3|And this is, uh, an artist who was, uh, really, um
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_524910_541169.wav|3|into, uh, where he was inspired by Lewis Carroll, uh, Alice in Wonderland, and, uh, he wanted to create a world, uh, where he could go in and live in, in his imagination.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_541791_544586.wav|3|And, uh so he created this world.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_544766_548528.wav|3|So this is only one of 52 paintings.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_549181_559286.wav|3|And it's actually not painting, it's, uh,  what is called when you, engravings on, on metal and then you print it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_560093_566653.wav|3|So it's engraved this and that I think that's amazing that someone has the ability to
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_567556_571068.wav|3|start from a blank metal piece and see this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_571159_574252.wav|3|Of course, he has to made, had to make sketches and stuff like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_576383_578505.wav|3|Oh, that's, have you seen the film Dune?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_579766_593264.wav|3|Yes, so this one is more modern, uh, and it's actually, it's actually a piece from, it's, it's a painting that should be a background in the movie.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_594288_612824.wav|3|And I have to,uh, say this and brag a bit because, uh, it's an original and I got it because, uh, I don't know Timothée Chalamet, but, uh, my former girlfriend knew him, so she got me this one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_614215_625021.wav|3|yeah so that has become really special because it's from him and he was in there so on the back you you he has dedicated it to me and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_629088_646567.wav|3|yes i am, uh,  i have to throw some things here but i think these boxes also, huh, i like to have them there because it feels like you don't know if you're moving in or moving out and i don't want to settle in too much i want to fit
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_649129_667693.wav|3|i don't know yet but it's nice you you know maybe i i could have them for the small one to throw my keys and stuff like that in and stuff like that and use the other one for magazines i don't read much but yeah thank you
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_43976_56021.wav|3|Just to have this view you know you have to pay a fortune but actually I managed to do it like this so this used to be my grandmother's apartment
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_77887_81507.wav|3|The whole area actually, the whole building was a factory.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_127261_131583.wav|3|eh it's, and that's why the whole area is called the magazine.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_170967_174986.wav|3|it's from the, you, you can't get that anymore.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_229535_231998.wav|3|they really mean a lot to me, these pillows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_309378_315191.wav|3|I really wanted to add some colors, uh,  so it doesn't seem too
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_369905_373427.wav|3|It looks like a, uh, bin.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_373766_381303.wav|3|with a, uh, a recycling bin, but it's actually the eternal movement of our souls
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_381943_384591.wav|3|and you can fill a void
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_500343_504087.wav|3|yeah oh and that means a lot to me it's a bit futuristic
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_211_002_main_504807_507714.wav|3|and, uh,  with, with, the flying, wh
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_002_main_0_7491.wav|3|Yes! And I mean.... I... I can... I feel that um could be I could be a very famous designer.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_002_main_211700_227889.wav|3|Yeah, that should be really nice because then you have a... table but you don't have you ee- ah w- w- what I think is missing here is that if you... have someone over and you take a cup of coffee you have nowhere to put the the coffee cups.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_46858_50271.wav|3|And that's the most interesting thing. W- What do you think of that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_55997_59161.wav|3|But what what happens if you look through the fireplace?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_60301_69590.wav|3|Yeah, so you can actually see I I think it's eh one of my greatest ideas actually because eh have you seen something like that before?

I really think I've I've done a great job. And! Ah the thing is because you can't have a fireplace there because the wall is too thin but uh it's actually a new technology so it's a plasma screen
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_107936_124428.wav|3|So, if i'm taking the remote there, I can show you later now it's too bright outside, but I hope you you stay for dinner and th- then i can show you.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_159625_177383.wav|3|And what I also like is that, what I can have, is to have, y- you can sit, y- you can have a larger group of people here. And, eh as you see, I haven't, I I've been taking care of the space in the room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_178435_185249.wav|3|And eh what do you think those two bins are? By the window.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_214087_242320.wav|3|Every day when I come home, I put my... bad thoughts in the red bin and I put my good thoughts in the blue bin.

I'm a bit tired so open the window and I pour out the bad thoughts so every day I'm getting rid of my bad thoughts from the day before and then I...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_245314_249840.wav|3|symbolic wash in the blue bin and and cover myself in good thoughts.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_415836_429475.wav|3|Yeah, so so I think but, it's like the, if if you look up there and you see the Jaguar, eh it's made of jade and eh it's eh,

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_473387_501336.wav|3|so the towel is eh textile and and the rest is bronze ehm so you have to be careful with the textile because you know you don't want to... i- it's quite delicate but it's the original uh towel so it's uh but I I think maybe i should have to to get some kind of uh glass cover for it so it doesn't... Yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_504730_527371.wav|3|Yes eh and and eh, as you can see it's also it's it's like that eh jaguar eh and also that one and then it's eh like carpet it's a real carpet ah and eh what I mean by that is that it's eh an old antique carpet
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_528234_544711.wav|3|Eh from eh the Middle East eh from Iraq handmade eh and this is what I could afford because this one eh if you if you want to buy a bigger one it's uh ten times the cost of this one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_545090_565037.wav|3|So I'm I'm into uh the Middle East and and also India, ah same as Europe, America. And and that's, I I I I think you can see, I think I've actually managed to make something ehm of it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_565457_569189.wav|3|A- nd, you know, ehm,

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_689151_705778.wav|3|give all the credits to her husband because there y- you weren't supposed to be a designer in the thirties if you were if... Yes it's really sad but uh and luckily she actually got credit for her work in the end of the nineties.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_706136_713202.wav|3|But she had to wait for sixty years to get acknowledged as one of the greatest designers in the world.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_002_main_713591_719686.wav|3|So I really like this lamp. It's a symbol because I have eh a daughter and I have two granddaughters.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_274510_278291.wav|3|I think if you, if you like any one of those, you could have one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_280809_300665.wav|3|yes you can have that one so so you you can, uh,  remember your time here and then let her find a, uh,  new home, uh.., and then, uh,,  yes then otherwise everything is fine in here so do you have any suggestions on
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_310805_322929.wav|3|sell some stuff or leave some stuff out for, you know, there are scouts, uh, the Swedish Scouts, and they could, uh, have it for their
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_326283_329238.wav|3|The Arabian Nights, Sherlock Holmes, and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_343269_347790.wav|3|I noticed that, uh, did you watch TV a lot?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_363785_371633.wav|3|Yes, but, but you know, it's,  it's not actually for, it's not a desk, but, uh, so if you used it as, what did you sit on when you were there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_373582_375951.wav|3|Ah, you, you were standing, of course, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_379113_383155.wav|3|But it's just actually, it's, it's an old, uh, it's from my mother.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_386716_391730.wav|3|So it was, uh, uhm, it was not intended to...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_396981_399982.wav|3|But do you think you would need somewhere to work?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_401863_404064.wav|3|Because I imagine this table isn't good enough.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_410382_418245.wav|3|And maybe have, you know, one of these, uh,  cushions that you have like a little table that you put in your knee.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_418305_420626.wav|3|I could have that one in the sofa if that would be.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_421421_424662.wav|3|But do you like the idea of being able to stand up?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_437242_462570.wav|3|so so and i was thinking of the bins there, uh, do you need one of the bins because you could take one if you want to yes of course take it it's you can have it because i was anyway trying to so so yeah okay now i would love to take this off oh
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_115682_118458.wav|3|told you that when you moved in

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_329886_332166.wav|3|also that old magazine there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_222_003_main_392339_394798.wav|3|But I understand that you thought that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_8328_10997.wav|3|Yeah, but we we can't walk around in entire room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_27107_34500.wav|3|So it is so nice that you came here and I just want to... I just have to brag of it. Ah, you see this couch and and the...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_34902_37892.wav|3|What you call this one in Swedish eh or in English, fåtölj?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_38941_52306.wav|3|Chair yes this- armchair, yes, this armchair eh is really really amazing because it's a Danish designer who's uh really famous. He's called... his name is eh Jensen.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_53020_59745.wav|3|And he's also doing uh like... other stuff, like like the vases there. He designed those.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_64272_68628.wav|3|Eh, so he designed them and... just various colors, but he designed them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_69115_77679.wav|3|And I really like the Danish em designers because they're doing so simple things and and yet so beautiful.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_78238_81104.wav|3|Ah, and that's Danish as well, the table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_81985_90491.wav|3|Ah, of course... really expensive, but what do you do when you love something?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_91023_96133.wav|3|Ah and that table there is actually from the fifties.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_97042_102149.wav|3|Ah and his name, the designer's name, was Kristiansen.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_102945_117237.wav|3|And unfortunately, actually, there are not... a lot of female designers that... that are famous. But if you look at the armchair over there by the desk, that's actually a female designer.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_118228_128284.wav|3|Yes, of course. I'm all into Danish stuff when it comes to furnitures, but eh I'm I'm also into like the little statue...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_129380_137578.wav|3|Eh that one, the female, ah the curvy female, that's actually a symbol of em...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_147584_152673.wav|3|Of of fertility, that's supposed to be a Peruvian ah fertility symbol.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_154138_158943.wav|3|Unfortunately, the copy because you you can't bring the real stuff out.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_160151_170652.wav|3|Y- yes, I went to Picamacho ahm... and eh then I went the eh Inca Trail, ah which was so exciting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_173777_177370.wav|3|Ah, sorry, I just had a text message.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_177848_190081.wav|3|And em no, that was really interesting. And, and then, then, of course, I'm also into more modern stuff like the hand there, ah which I really enjoy because it's
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_191138_204448.wav|3|at the same time eh demanding and asking you could you give me or you have to give me so I think it's a lot of stuff in it and of course I can also put some bananas in it if I want to.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_211345_233208.wav|3|Yes, of course, because I'm also into art and eh of course you know you you can't buy the actual yeah the the the ones you want like a Matisse or something but that one is really really interesting and that's one of my most valuable paintings
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_233762_251151.wav|3|eh because it's eh made by an American eh artist who lived in the nineteenth century and he described a lot of eh the movement towards the west of the country.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_259892_267345.wav|3|So it's eh really eh raising my insurance fees because uh it's really valuable.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_268030_280488.wav|3|And em so that's the only painting I have that includes human beings because I'm more into landscapes and and I I'm very much into em darker stuff like that one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_282614_285045.wav|3|uh it's... it's a ship.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_285473_288713.wav|3|It could be a ship or it could be a ghost ship or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_290411_302595.wav|3|And if you look to the left, you see th- there's a we- could be rocks or or like the Flying Dutchman, ah or the Pirates of Caribbean, of course, too.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_303127_307425.wav|3|And... and you see this darkness coming and...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_311788_315481.wav|3|And I th- three- th- really think it's interesting because it's ah
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_324376_333763.wav|3|Yes, and and I I don't care that much about eh styles. I I I I want things that I like and enjoy to see, like for instance this lamp.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_333815_338214.wav|3|It's totally out of, uh doesn't look like anything in this room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_339533_354428.wav|3|Ah but eh that's... so that's actually two things. The... the lower part, the lamp, it's eh ah that's quite modern. It's from the sixties, from a Swedish designer actually.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_354911_359048.wav|3|And the... what ou call that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_359280_368943.wav|3|The cover or wh- wh- whatever you call it, that's actually from my grandparents' house. So I I mixed those.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_370645_374295.wav|3|Yes. Yes, I I think it's nice to have uh various things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_374687_384239.wav|3|And then of course, uh I... I... I always wonder why w- why I turned the sofa this way when I have this wonderful view.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_384496_392488.wav|3|Uh... Actually, I... I'm starting to think about refurnishing now that you... you came... because I should have it there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_401344_411288.wav|3|But on the other hand, I I don't look much at TV and... the window could be my TV because there are a lot of eh deers outside and the um it's...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_417770_436314.wav|3|No, I just have that one because it's ehm... that one doesn't eh care eh need much care eh because I forget to water... I I don't know why I have the water eh w- water there, eh but you know, it's... it should be on the table, but eh maybe it's because...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_436830_447432.wav|3|because I read somewhere that you should have the water in the the water... watering thing eh to to get the...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_452561_455680.wav|3|eh going down so you don't get too much on the plants.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_456065_459241.wav|3|But on the other hand, that that one can take anything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_001_main_467931_470139.wav|3|Oh my god, you can walk through walls.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_25650_29349.wav|3| You look so strange because you're uh leaning on nothing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_56558_60763.wav|3|Oh, there was a really... low couches.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_70256_73209.wav|3|Yes, it is. W- w- Sorry, w- what are we now?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_75132_78127.wav|3|Oh, it's my new apartment. Yeah. I'm showing off?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_80916_97642.wav|3|No, so I I really like this place because uh as you can see... It's really spacious and... w- what you see outside that appears to be a balcony isn't a balcony because uh w- they couldn't have a balcony
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_100017_123209.wav|3|Eh, it's a window. So so you're just supposed to think it's a balcony. But you can actually open it... that way. Uh because if you would open it that way you would walk out uh... But it's... eh since we are eh twelve meters up in the air you don't want to fall over the...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_124185_137901.wav|3|Yeah. And eh... No, I know, I also like the way... A- the... this this is my idea actually to build little eh you can see the artwork in the wall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_141300_149521.wav|3|Eh ff eh, there are so many. I like the vase, I like that. That one is one... definitely one of my favorites. The...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_150982_154243.wav|3|It looks like an absurd painting of some kind.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_154878_159195.wav|3|Yeah, it looks, eh you know, eh the gaila l- looks like this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_159918_167555.wav|3|Ah and then there's ah the cheetah ah and ah the dog over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_168225_193260.wav|3|And then of course, eh. Oh my god that was tough! Uh it's hard to say that I have a favorite! But I I like the f- female eh symbol of fertility over... up there. And, I also like that Greek eh thing, over there. Yeah. And, I also like this one. Eh, the woman without hair that's going to eh...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_194364_205987.wav|3|Yeah, on the table there, uh because she's eh... You don't know if she's coming up from the sea or is going down to the beach or whatever she is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_208919_232030.wav|3|Yes, I I enjoy having, w- when I have a lot of guests, but... Eh, I'm... You know, I'm I'm... both an extrovert and an introvert, so I enjoy being by myself... But, eh and and not having... I like having people home, but not every week.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_235221_243778.wav|3|Eh yes, I'm I'm doing some, so so that box, eh, I just eh took up that statue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_244102_248294.wav|3|Eh, so the statue was in that box, so I haven't removed it yet, so I forgot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_248833_252399.wav|3|Eh, and also you see the, this bench here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_253672_274551.wav|3|That's eh, of course if if if I get more artwork because you have to... think ahead, you can't just eh have things... from what you have today, so eh here I can have a lot of eh artwork and eh ff as you can see eh I I I enjoy small pieces.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_285838_292460.wav|3|It's actually, w- what I use it for is that I, eh, oh, oh, it's in the bin.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_295078_303190.wav|3|And eh so I usually sit in the... armchair with the blue... circular pillow there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_303714_309945.wav|3|And then I like to, because it's quite difficult to sit there, and you can hardly see the bin.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_310556_320134.wav|3|Eh and then I have a set of ten balls, and then I throw it up there. Yeah, it's good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_320305_332246.wav|3|Yes, and it's eh... it's like meditation for me, and you have to focus, and you can't stress doing it, and you're totally focused on that thing. You don't think uh of other things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_337198_339405.wav|3|That eh b- n- n-
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_341048_358980.wav|3|No no no but eh that that's just an old lamp so so if if it's ruined... Oh, I see! You know. Eh. My god I have to take that away because... Uh, I could put it in box... You see the gray stuff there? No it was my former girlfriend who did...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_360920_372344.wav|3|a lot of weird stuff but she put those up. It's rubber and and I call it rubbish eh because it's... looks so stupid on that old lamp but eh
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_374190_382683.wav|3|Yes ehm... but on the other hand eh it eh.... I... I don't like it but eh
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_384215_394908.wav|3|It's a nice... thing. Uh. When I see it, I can remember her and and be a bit annoyed by her at the same time as she meant a lot to me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_396256_419132.wav|3|No. And eh I'm thinking of uh getting more plants, you see I only have two ahm eh in the corner there and the other one is eh between the chairs. Yes, and what I was thinking of eh as you can open... uh the windows a bit if if if I should...
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_420607_428184.wav|3|in some way, move everything up here, the two armchairs, so I could have eh ff used the entire window.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_436519_456908.wav|3|No, it's because y- as you see th- this is for uh lighting up but but all the other lamps, that one, that one, and that one eh it's eh because w- w- when it's dark I can bring this down a bit and then you have like
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_458609_474069.wav|3|it it doesn't get... You have a light but you you can have it quite intimate here a- and you can have more light around the table if you want to and as you can see that remote control ah is not just for the tv it's also for the lights
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_227_001_main_477461_498715.wav|3|Oh it is, it's eh, as you can see it's not an old chandelier ah and it's actually made... from the material is from eh an old fence that surrounded eh my grandmother's house and I had a blacksmith eh make this out of the fence.

data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_78106_82527.wav|3|They will hang down like a waterfall of green leaves.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_83368_88609.wav|3|That's my intention anyway because I'm, I'm really into, uh,  plants.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_90153_98896.wav|3|What's nice with these plants too, like the, that's called the tongue of mother-in-law, the one by the window in Swedish.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_100792_103194.wav|3|Because, eh, it's called Dragon Tongue.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_113993_116081.wav|3|And that, of course, is Monstera.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_118628_120986.wav|3|I actually bought it from
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_123908_129897.wav|3|eh, So it's brought here by a friend as just a little, little cutting..
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_130571_133284.wav|3|And now it's looks like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_133845_136848.wav|3|And, uh, that's only in three months.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_137068_140272.wav|3|So I have to say I have green fingers.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_140369_142434.wav|3|And yes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_143196_146181.wav|3|And do you wonder about the kettle I have there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_150915_154058.wav|3|Because when you boil water, you clean it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_155268_161947.wav|3|And if you want the plants to grow properly, you, you want the water to be as clean as possible.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_162334_167011.wav|3|But of course, you also take out the nourishment in the water.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_167023_171906.wav|3|So you have to add nourishment, uh, fertilizers and so.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_173246_176648.wav|3|But it's really important to have clean water.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_177312_184992.wav|3|And then I let it stand there for two or three weeks and then I put it in regular water.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_186172_192815.wav|3|Just one deciliter of pure water and then not dirty water, but regular tap water.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_205799_212813.wav|3|I'm glad you like them because, eh,  those are really, really meaning a lot to me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_213805_215806.wav|3|They used to belong to my grandmother.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_218598_223168.wav|3|I have so many memories of them, with them, together with.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_223188_229731.wav|3|Because, you know, every time I was with my... We didn't watch much TV in those days because I'm 60 years old.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_234718_238538.wav|3|It wasn't like today when you can watch TV all day or Netflix or anything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_239119_242762.wav|3|So we played a lot of games and we also listened to the radio.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_243891_251949.wav|3|And whenever, or, or my grandmother would tell me stories from her childhood, and then I always sat on the floor.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_253030_260176.wav|3|So I sat on one of the pillows and then I, eh, the white one, and then I had the green one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_260896_282960.wav|3|like this and I would listen to her because they lived up north and it was so exciting to listen to her stories about reindeers and stuff like that and they also she she also believed in she was very spiritual so she believed in maybe not spirits but that energies remained
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_286722_292123.wav|3|So actually feel that my, my grandmother is with me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_293544_296927.wav|3|Oh, my hair stands when I talk about her.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_297167_299628.wav|3|So maybe she's here now and likes this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_301971_304033.wav|3|So I'm, I'm glad you like them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_317095_319199.wav|3|yeah maybe it's just
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_333841_347047.wav|3|don't need my watch so I put it over there and I I okay it's like this I have ADHD, eh, so sometimes I just put something down and then I forget that I've put it down so
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_360321_366887.wav|3|And I always look for it because sometimes it's, uh, going beneath, uh, the cushion.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_377597_382982.wav|3|Yes, because I understand what you mean, because you would like the chair to be this way.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_383943_391910.wav|3|But there's a very good explanation for it, because have you heard of an artist called Benjamin Kokomovic?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_393812_397891.wav|3|Oh, he was very much into spirituality.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_398573_414959.wav|3|And what he said was that if you place a chair like that, in that direction, to, right into, to a wall, you can actually, uh, attract spirits.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_415843_418566.wav|3|And so that's why it's like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_424644_431618.wav|3|okay, I don't know if you're into this, but actually, I, I am very much in contact with the other world.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_432209_451120.wav|3|So what happens is, uh, because this chair is really special, uh, it belong, once belonged to a great psychic, a Swedish psychic, and whenever, uh, someone comes to visit me, the light goes tick, tick, tick, tick.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_451987_461817.wav|3|And, uh, so I know they're there and sometimes, uh, I ask them, is it right if I join you?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_463819_467923.wav|3|So one blink is yes, two blinks is no.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_468303_470565.wav|3|But if I, what do you think I do then?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_473782_476897.wav|3|No, if it's okay, what do you think I do?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_478478_480519.wav|3|Yes, when I join them, what do you think I do then?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_487502_493726.wav|3|So I sit like when I sat with my grandmother, so I sit on the white one and have the green one like this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_502018_524462.wav|3|I I know what you... I know it might look a bit strange but actually it's... I used to have the plant over there so it's a UV light, uh,  but, uh then of course when I bought that chair I had to ask the chair actually where it wanted to be
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_524854_553017.wav|3|and it wanted to be there so and I haven't moved the lamp yet but it should be and as you see it's I am now taking away the UV light because I have two similar lights up there my god I forgot about those I never use them actually well and now when you tell me when you're noticing it it looks quite off in this room
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_561675_567013.wav|3|No, but now that you mention it, it, it actually looked like, like the belt of Orion.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_570056_573659.wav|3|Maybe there is something I've, I've done without thinking about it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_573928_576442.wav|3|I really have to check that before I take them down.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_576562_579926.wav|3|But, uh, they were very expensive, those lamps.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_586543_594651.wav|3|Yes, eh, because I'm not, as you can see, I'm, I'm not very much into art.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_598253_601255.wav|3|So I just have the one with the flowers.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_612044_615451.wav|3|And I love the tree over there because it's so
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_617748_620232.wav|3|It's like, have you seen the film Matrix?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_620894_626202.wav|3|Yeah, you know, in the room where they study martial arts and stuff like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_629710_635925.wav|3|I could imagine when when we die that we come to a place like that at first.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_638427_640545.wav|3|Yeah, or tree of death.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_641109_649956.wav|3|And, uh, maybe it's, uh, it looks really peaceful, but could also be a tree of wisdom and and stuff like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_654825_658249.wav|3|is, uh, also one of my grandmothers.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_662819_672402.wav|3|like in art, but I like that one because when I was a kid, I used to sit in front of it and imagine that I was living there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_675246_693150.wav|3|it was my dad, it was, because my parents were divorced and I never met my dad, and that my dad was waiting for me, because you can see that there's one horse without anyone on it, and that he was waiting for me to come there, and that my mother was driving that carriage.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_699935_706502.wav|3|And I like an open space because I can do my morning yoga here and yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_707880_725165.wav|3|And, it's, it's also from, eh, it's from Cairo in Egypt and it was, uh, it actually, the symbols here means that, that, that's the afterlife and the life we're in now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_726016_734345.wav|3|and all the various... My God, there's something wrong with my hand, I have to... Yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_106602_110903.wav|3|In the old way, everyone thought their mother-in-law was a dragon.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_324568_329067.wav|3|throw off my shoes and i i just want to go in and and relax and
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_606549_609441.wav|3|feel something for a painting, then I buy it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_210_001_main_658370_661568.wav|3|it's not what I like, but
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_54602_57626.wav|4|Wait, how do I walk to a certain place?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_59404_62942.wav|4|Oh, so how do I like, interact with the object then?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_64786_66963.wav|4|I'll point at it like, okay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_84071_92296.wav|4|Uh, you just kind of phased through the wall right there, but um, assuming that you weren't an extra dimensional being,
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_92633_95545.wav|4|Let me just show you what's here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_95564_98259.wav|4|So you have my couch here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_104871_108239.wav|4|I don't know if they actually make couches out of cotton, but this one is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_111167_113985.wav|4|Ah, they're red because my car's red
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_116707_119310.wav|4|Yes, because I'm very bad at remembering things.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_119651_126994.wav|4|That's why I also, I sleep every day with a copy of, ah... a copy of the news right here, this thing here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_127353_130183.wav|4|Oh, yeah, because when I wake up, I don't remember where I am.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_130577_134346.wav|4|And I have to remember that I'm on the planet Earth, and I need to read the date.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_141394_144872.wav|4|Actually, you might have noticed the doors don't have handles.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_148064_150728.wav|4|And then yeah, I'm like, how do I get here?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_150749_159018.wav|4|I just I just Yeah, I have a remote job, at least so I can, you can see over there at my, my monitor and my computer, I can't connect them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_159544_164563.wav|4|But like I just like sometimes when I'm doing work on my laptop, I imagine it's on my
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_173525_180888.wav|4|But you might have noticed, uh, besides that I have many beautiful furnishings, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_193869_197917.wav|4|Yeah, yeah, I found it in the trash can actually.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_200932_203917.wav|4|You might have noticed they're actually a different size.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_206527_209257.wav|4|Right, oh, sorry, something just fell off.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_216293_218940.wav|4|I, I like, um, I like going through the trash.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_219481_223844.wav|4|I find many crazy things, uh, like that, that, uh...
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_225421_227940.wav|4|uh, that little golden dish there, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_238808_244752.wav|4|So, well, yeah, but I just keep it there because it looks cool, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_258245_261612.wav|4|I couldn't afford, I couldn't even afford like a frame for two of them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_263071_266986.wav|4|Those two, I like them a little bit more, so I gave them my frame.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_270419_274071.wav|4|With the paintings, you know what?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_274111_279804.wav|4|I like that one right behind you, that one, because it looks very open and wide, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_279816_283805.wav|4|And as I've mentioned, I'm kind of stuck in this room, like eternally.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_283893_286288.wav|4|I think it's like a sort of divine punishment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_286759_294273.wav|4|So yeah, it just reminds me that somewhere there's like a beautiful ocean.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_294313_297475.wav|4|I can kind of just smell the breeze almost.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_307196_314885.wav|4|So you might have noticed, I actually have, I think I have that one on the stool there at the end of the table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_315848_319476.wav|4|That is, I think, I can't see from over here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_330060_337256.wav|4|And that one to the right, uh. Actually, that's the Hotentote Venus.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_341278_348316.wav|4|Well, I don't know if it's an original, but it's a fetish from Africa.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_348924_354444.wav|4|There's a type of, in the south of Africa, actually, there's a,
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_355700_358838.wav|4|a group of people that have very enlarged buttockses.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_359273_375848.wav|4|And around the turn of the 9th, uh, 20th century, yes, they actually captured a woman who had a similar figure to that and brought her around Europe.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_381994_388046.wav|4|And they called it, they named her after that statue, I think, because she had a similar figure.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_388239_392001.wav|4|It was part of their whole scientific racism type dealio, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_393222_397695.wav|4|But yeah, I bring those statues into my room to be depressed, you know?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_397756_400947.wav|4|Because like that painting there makes me feel too happy.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_400987_403564.wav|4|So I just look down and I'm like, oh, racism.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_408190_412833.wav|4|Yeah, let's yeah. I mean.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_419416_421727.wav|4|Not many channels, no.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_423692_426824.wav|4|I watch the TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_426887_430430.wav|4|I can't, like. I know what you mean.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_main_436868_440333.wav|4|Yeah, it's for looks.

data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_14108_17363.wav|4|Let me just... What's in here?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_24733_28460.wav|4|Yeah, just take a sledgehammer and go bam, bam, bam.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_34543_42479.wav|4|It's seat because... Because look at... Well, I mean... That's for the contractors to worry about.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_47281_49983.wav|4|So we're mainly just talking about the objects, and I see how it is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_52329_55577.wav|4|Uh let's see... Uh, first things first.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_59758_61942.wav|4|Because they break up the room too much, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_76429_79478.wav|4|Because the thing is, this is what I tell people.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_79498_83156.wav|4|It's like you can't have a television in a room because it distracts.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_83184_85559.wav|4|It distracts from everything else.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_85623_90930.wav|4|See, because when you walk into a room, right, it's like walking into a piece of art.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_91211_96057.wav|4|Like these art pieces you have on the wall, which coincidentally also have to go.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_98320_106861.wav|4|But like when you walk into a room, right, you look around, you know, and really it's like you're walking into a Picasso.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_107212_119842.wav|4|So, so you really can't have a television like that there because, I mean, it's just like people aren't gonna see... what, like you because this room is you, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_122812_125081.wav|4|Art has also got to go because it's got to be you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_126366_136868.wav|4|Trash can, got to go because I'm like, that one, that one right there, the white one, I mean, that one also has to go, that one in the corner, but both of them, they got to go.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_137721_145513.wav|4|Because you can't like, having trash in your room suggests that, right, that like, you're trash.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_148481_150681.wav|4|Desk, no, got to go.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_151065_154297.wav|4|Then the computer and the chair because that reminds people of work, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_154782_158788.wav|4|When people walk into your room, they don't want to be reminded of work.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_158808_163814.wav|4|They wanna, wanna be taken to, to another another plane of existence.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_173308_176762.wav|4|The paintings, these guys, they shouldn't do that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_179290_181715.wav|4|It's like, it's like crack cocaine, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_182158_184189.wav|4|It makes you feel good for a while.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_184591_188520.wav|4|But then after, you know, after a certain point, it just takes over your entire life.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_188559_190817.wav|4|And then you become an interior designer.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_208630_213968.wav|4|You should keep it only so long as it's being used to destroy everything else in this room, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_214887_218360.wav|4|Everything that we've talked about here, just push it in there and light on fire.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_224456_226520.wav|4|That, that actually, that can stay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_226587_232402.wav|4|You know, you need a little bit of green energy in your room. You know to have the chi flowing, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_244471_250306.wav|4|Those, both of those, they were stolen from their respective countries, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_258613_262048.wav|4|Yeah, the, the police are actually on their way right now to arrest you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_269172_286278.wav|4|The hand of, I mean, you should, in fact, that hand, get ten more and just, like, let's sprawl them all across the room right here, because I think it really says a lot about you as a person, as that you have hands.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_298636_301228.wav|4|But when you have ten, they're like, why is there ten hands?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_304392_306690.wav|4|Because no one's ever like, why do you have two hands?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_306706_309821.wav|4|But if you have ten hands, they're like, oh, there's something interesting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_318572_323479.wav|4|I mean. I think you can, I think you can guess where the vases go.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_326256_330036.wav|4|Uhmmmm...
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_378983_381819.wav|4|I mean, this whole room is a catastrophe, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_384479_388200.wav|4|I mean, there's one hand, but I mean, everyone has just one hand.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_396096_399339.wav|4|It looks like, you see that little, a little structure in the middle?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_403498_408446.wav|4|And I really like Honey Nut Cheerios, so it can stay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_408930_411969.wav|4|It can stay, but just as long as you also like Honey Nut Cheerios.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_418930_421461.wav|4|That book, that's one thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_421517_426514.wav|4|That book, it also has, I mean, like knowledge is just, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_426570_429531.wav|4|I mean, you've read the Bible, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_430013_434617.wav|4|Like, Adam and Eve, they eat the fruit of knowledge from the tree, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_434624_436826.wav|4|And then Satan kills everybody, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_437030_439171.wav|4|So that book has also got to go.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_441292_445071.wav|4|You've got to burn it right this second before the police come and arrest you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_453539_456194.wav|4|Yeah, yeah, I think that's almost everything.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_458129_460317.wav|4|That credit card over there should do nicely.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_003_main_254519_257218.wav|4|Aaaa, no, it's cultural appropriation still.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_11775_14785.wav|4|So, let me get this straight. So, you're.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_16343_18344.wav|4|Because. I have, I have a lot of units.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_18875_25477.wav|4|Are you touring this or are you checking out and I'm going through everything?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_31465_34190.wav|4|Yeah, let me just yeah, check my, okay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_34733_38234.wav|4|So I know, okay, so now I've remembered where everything should be, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_38651_42220.wav|4|So I see you've kept Daisy alive here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_56427_61123.wav|4|I see you've put my watering can just on the floor, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_63053_65073.wav|4|You gonna, you gonna get some water damage on it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_65790_69328.wav|4|This is cedar right here, this floor.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_128936_132955.wav|4|Net, neut, neural network equipment machine elected president.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_138420_161556.wav|4|That's nuts well okay artwork check check oh there was a there was a third one right there see because because it doesn't make it's it's see this it's not symmetric anymore right there's only two and then there's a big empty space there these two see there's these two right here right but there's supposed to be a third one see that little empty space behind the computer?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_174029_177962.wav|4|Yeah, so it's going to cost a little bit more than most deposits.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_185930_188796.wav|4|Yeah, it's a little bit small, but you know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_191282_194014.wav|4|It's a nephew clock right now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_199611_204735.wav|4|But, there is no like keyboard. You know what I'm saying?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_216127_220553.wav|4|So far you're only down one Picasso and some water damage.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_220582_223088.wav|4|Okay, we're going well so far.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_225171_227557.wav|4|I don't want to walk over and check because I'm too lazy.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_231423_235594.wav|4|It's been the thing that, you know, the images will get dusty if you don't turn it on.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_241742_246517.wav|4|Because they, they charge you if you don't use the television, because we're in America, obviously.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_249219_252628.wav|4|Why, why is the recycling over there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_252681_256991.wav|4|I mean, the trash can... There is....Why is it in the corner?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_268677_270994.wav|4|Like, like, okay, so like over the back.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_282871_286278.wav|4|I'm, I'm glad I ran out to a very exclusive clientele.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_293555_296248.wav|4|That one statue, it's been moved onto a little stool there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_320399_322755.wav|4|Yeah, they look pretty, they look very clean, actually.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_323389_325688.wav|4|I mean, did you just clean those?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_332431_336602.wav|4|Because those vases, they're not regular vases.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_338747_347015.wav|4|So some tenants, when they move out and they do not have, the deposit can't cover everything, I steal their souls and put them in the jar.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_354590_356772.wav|4|That, that, that means that they've basically given up.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_359357_363626.wav|4|But in a few months, it'll be clear like the rest of them because he'll have given up on trying to get out.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_366266_368947.wav|4|But in his mind, he's still in the room, actually, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_369287_376306.wav|4|He still thinks he's here and that his friend's gonna come over and he's going to show him, but he's stuck here forever.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_403292_407836.wav|4|That box, the cardboard box, you've just... What is that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_423723_427005.wav|4|I'll build, uh, yeah, I'll build the card.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_427235_431079.wav|4|Actually, I'll build that,  build that card right there so that your correct card on the table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_002_main_305887_308143.wav|4|Uuuuhhhmmm...
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_42525_45508.wav|4|Okay, so what what what specifically reminds you of that person?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_59349_71790.wav|4|Okay, I'm seeing I'm seeing okay, so you're talking about like that little statue here like this this little woman Yeah, and there's a guy and there's the little guy hmm, okay
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_75910_82382.wav|4|Maybe, instead of having them all all splayed around, like like you have them here, maybe you could just line them up.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_82844_87353.wav|4|Maybe like, maybe like take them and just line them up along here
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_96671_99046.wav|4|It's kind of overwhelming if you hate statues.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_101287_104581.wav|4|So I'm just saying, just take them and put them put them in a corner.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_120935_124196.wav|4|So what you could do is, uh, take the paintings.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_124476_126970.wav|4|So that's one there another one  there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_130068_135352.wav|4|Yeah, so just take them and maybe like put them, you know, opposite where you, when come in, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_135651_141172.wav|4|So take those guys and put them on that wall, so that when he come in, you're immediately hit with them, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_142065_144405.wav|4|And because of that, you also now get rid of the chandelier here,
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_144808_147074.wav|4|Because the chandelier is blocking the vision, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_147114_154420.wav|4|So, So yeah, so put, put the statues there, paintings there, chandelier, trash.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_169324_172368.wav|4|Number one rule of interior design, no computers.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_183915_186162.wav|4|Why, why is that plant just, like, sitting there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_200753_203015.wav|4|Like you see there, like it's completely ruining this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_203118_209282.wav|4|Like if someone wants to walk around your, your, your sofa,it's, it's going to be in their way, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_217874_221243.wav|4|Yeah, I'd say probably you want to move it onto the balcony so it gets more sun.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_222500_226793.wav|4|Because unless that's a UV bulb, which, I mean, who would put a UV bulb in a lamp, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_228290_231898.wav|4|Just put it on in the, the sun so it gets, it gets more, more
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_247994_251738.wav|4|Speaking of the couches, these pillows, what's the deal with that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_261427_264017.wav|4|This one's like, it's like, it's been completely screwed, it's like
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_267430_272866.wav|4|Yeah, yeah, yeah, just like pick it up, box, actually yeah, instead, instead of throwing just things out, put it, put it in the box.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_274063_278185.wav|4|Pillow, box, uh, chandelier, box, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_291947_295010.wav|4|I say, poor people live on the streets, you live,
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_313311_317294.wav|4|Yeah, it really, it really reminds me of like a, like a bee for some reason, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_317309_323257.wav|4|Like you got like that little, little, uhm,  honey dipper and and like the little, the hexagon, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_325839_330753.wav|4|It's like someone won them in like a, like a, like a honey nut Cheerios competition or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_364611_366671.wav|4|Yeah, well, glad it all, glad it all worked out.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_366674_371385.wav|4|I'll be, I'll be asking for payment, if that's OK, from the little credit card there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_372639_375328.wav|4|I'll just pocket that real quick.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_283406_288801.wav|4|put them in the box, and then put the box, just, just  throw it off, throw it off, off, off your balcony.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_341776_344738.wav|4|but like maybe just move the
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_227_002_main_345476_349950.wav|4|trash can to the other side of the room, just so it's kind of more, eh
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_13677_19538.wav|4|Let's do interior design, I guess, because I'm also this is kind of wrapped around my head.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_34614_37995.wav|4|Okay, so was the audio coming into the last one then?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_48179_51680.wav|4|Well, I'm an American, so I talk pretty loudly, so hopefully it it came through.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_73908_78249.wav|4|And this is why you hired me to be your, uh, your your interior designer person?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_96999_104206.wav|4|Artistic person I see that's why I have that like this this guy up here right there like this Yeah, what is what is what is it?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_115461_121845.wav|4|Well then, see, the issue is if you have something like that, you're trying to convey freedom engineering, you can't have a table like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_121905_125527.wav|4|See this guy over here, what, what your, what your television's laying on, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_128553_131451.wav|4|It's conveying the exact opposite of what you want.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_132371_134792.wav|4|You should have something that's that's free and open, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_148416_150771.wav|4|And the, and this bear here, who is, who is that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_155821_161524.wav|4|Well, you need to get rid of those cause like it's, it's the exact opposite of freedom if you think about it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_163816_167120.wav|4|The kids, but the bears too, yeah, because bears, bears will maul you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_187108_189595.wav|4|they suggest that you're always about to leave.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_196999_201227.wav|4|Keys, I mean, you should get like a jar for these or else you're going to lose them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_211747_217302.wav|4|Yeah, yeah, ye, I mean, just what I do is I hide them in places.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_217343_226210.wav|4|So like maybe that plant there or that plant, I would just hide them like just just throw them in, you know, and then you know, it's like they're not even there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_246050_252066.wav|4|Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry to say that, but pots, pots and and engineering, they don't, they don't mix.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_253026_257621.wav|4|You should have made, you should have made like a, like a pencil, a pencil holder or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_260036_262453.wav|4|Yeah, you can fit one in just like at, at the, at the top.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_266331_271873.wav|4|Well, you know, that, that's what they that's what they say, you know, some things you can't over engineer, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_272493_278776.wav|4|So maybe maybe it's like a, it's like a, you know, form follows function, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_279636_284598.wav|4|So I think I think, you know, you just make sure you put your pencils on them, and it's okay.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_310768_314449.wav|4|you you should just break them, and then, but leave them there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_324613_328095.wav|4|cause people, when they see a pot, they're like, it shouldn't be broken, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_328115_335318.wav|4|But if it's, if it's already comes broken, it's like you're telling them, this is me, I'm free, I can do what I want.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_353922_358265.wav|4|Yeah, because engineers, everyone knows an engineer uses uses Android, and that's an Apple phone.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_382679_386020.wav|4|Let me just write down your credit card number right here, just in case I lose it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_390030_392283.wav|4|Ah, see, now you're thinking outside the box.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_392303_394324.wav|4|That's what an engineer, a smart engineer.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_399465_401546.wav|4|Man, this has, this has all turned out so well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_401626_405247.wav|4|I mean, yeah, this is all working out very well for you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_405387_411651.wav|4|I'm I'm proud that we're coming to like, uh, like we're we're starting to see the new you in this room.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_421813_426897.wav|4|Either you have a new television, like those those flat ones you put on the wall, or you just get rid of it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_426937_429558.wav|4|But right now, this is screaming 2009.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_436886_440909.wav|4|That'll show them, because remember, you're, you've got to be free.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_463193_466211.wav|4|freedom within reason right we don't want to be unreasonable here
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_492709_499274.wav|4|like the phone, the credit card, the computer, maybe the television, the remote, obviously.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_499374_502058.wav|4|I mean, because, you know, you know
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_509440_511612.wav|4|yeah, I think, I think that's reasonable
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_523858_529440.wav|4|again, it's kind of like the table right the lamp has like these little bar as like this bar design
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_545146_547408.wav|4|Yes, yes, yes
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_549092_551995.wav|4|glad, I'm glad we're on, we're both on the same page here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_558356_560942.wav|4|Exactly, except for your, your, your artwork.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_292639_296726.wav|4|cause if you put the pencils in those long ones on the bottom here you see that yellow one the red one
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_297907_302671.wav|4|they're uh they're just gonna get stuck in there and then you get to bash them open anyway to get the pencil out right
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_315480_317800.wav|4|Cause it's like you've overcome,
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_141584_143941.wav|4|maybe it should have like, it should be, like, made of metal.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_538232_540943.wav|4|like it's just way too rigid, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_469921_475595.wav|4|Now but you know you know you know you should get rid of is that that laptop over there in the other in the other room you think
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_486433_492292.wav|4|just I'll just take one of these, you know, these boxes and just put everything I think you don't need in
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_211_002_main_512007_515713.wav|4|Anything else that, uh,  you have like qualms about in this room
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_23975_26885.wav|4|Yeah, it's looking good pretty far.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_31485_35547.wav|4|This painting here, was the ,was the, the frame always so white?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_36147_39269.wav|4|Because those two over there, they, they have, they brown frames, you see that?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_39449_42810.wav|4|But this one, I thought this one had a brown frame as well, why is it white?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_52130_54813.wav|4|Well, you've been here three years, I guess you would know better than me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_59875_61877.wav|4|Hey, there's something wrong here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_68761_72324.wav|4|Those guys, they also have a clay pot, but then that one h has a stone pot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_88374_90536.wav|4|notice a pattern here, but let's keep going, let's keep going.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_94439_97640.wav|4|Okay, but,but then also, so, those teapots, look at that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_98081_102203.wav|4|So there were three, see, three white teapots.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_102793_106146.wav|4|One, two, oh, but now there's a, now there's a green one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_117104_121687.wav|4|Yeah, is that why you also replaced,uh, my my pillow right there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_210_002_main_123268_127010.wav|4|Yeah, yeah, yeah,  they used to again to two white ones and now is a green one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_13100_15315.wav|2|that the light from that window, how it
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_17100_19576.wav|2|How it hits the floor? It's beautiful.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_20000_23532.wav|2|I think you should take everything away from that window and just
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_24718_29794.wav|2|That could be the center of the room. Really see how nicely it hits the floor.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_32900_35932.wav|2|so clear from the bins and the chair,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_38800_43608.wav|2|I think you should actually take this sofa and that's sofa and put them in the corner there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_47535_52467.wav|2|And then maybe that chair could be like, over in that corner just to open up that space.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_53894_58294.wav|2|and then the rug and the small table can go over here and sit like
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_60102_64381.wav|2|I don't know what this is. I think maybe that should go the, the weird.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_65745_68870.wav|2|Yeah, it is. Is it a desk? It's so high to be a desk.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_73940_78581.wav|2|Okay, I see well, maybe the work Corner, could be over here instead.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_80008_90208.wav|2|Uh, you can put like that small desk and the laptop here and have maybe a small chair, that could be so small that you can slide it under the desk when you're not using it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_98599_100967.wav|2|Working and watching TV at the same time.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_101600_103646.wav|2|Okay, well maybe then you should.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_107700_113640.wav|2|What did we say about this one? Nothing. Maybe. well, of course, if if the sofas are over there
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_120900_123742.wav|2|Turnable? Can you turn it? the TV?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_125100_132414.wav|2|Maybe or maybe you can get one of those. You know, they can I I think you can put it on the wall and have one of those like things you can pull out and.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_136903_141474.wav|2|Cuz then when you sit here and you're working, you can have the TV a bit like this.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_142587_145887.wav|2|And if you're sitting over there watching TV, you can have it a bit like that.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_162538_166111.wav|2|Um well, we have a beautiful fun go over here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_167480_171139.wav|2|It's so beautiful. I really love that painting.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_173590_178945.wav|2|I don't think it goes very well together with the old Farmers. I don't, I don't remember what that one's called.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_185110_191604.wav|2|Cuz they're so angry looking. I mean, they're funny in a way, but maybe it would be better to have those in the kitchen.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_195210_200280.wav|2|Would they go together better? I would say, cuz they're both old and sort of classic motives.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_201027_207960.wav|2|So maybe, but this does not work well together, the old Gogh go and the modern TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_208741_222108.wav|2|So I'm thinking better way would be to place the couches as we said over there, you have 1 of the paintings over that couch and the other painting over the other couch, preferably the big one over the on that wall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_229859_233542.wav|2|And I think the bins, they will have to be somewhere else.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_245083_252383.wav|2|Or maybe if you want to keep one then keep the red one cuz that goes well together with with the rug and you can have that next to your desk.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_254807_258274.wav|2|No, no, no. The lamp cannot be here. It's too weird.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_261269_266370.wav|2|But maybe since we said, we were going to have the couch over in that corner, maybe that's a good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_267300_272000.wav|2|Like place to have a lamp next to the couch so you can sit and read in your couch, right.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_280338_285104.wav|2|Oh, this one, which is, which is about, oh, that box. No, but that looks random.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_295587_301542.wav|2|Yeah, and it has all a basket with handles and you can store it, but it also looks a bit nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_302338_306838.wav|2|But I know what you mean. It's good to be able to stuff things away, and I don't know, just
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_309100_316584.wav|2|Clean up a bit so you don't have tennis rackets and books lying around and watches and stuff. Just so the surfaces are clean.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_319526_324826.wav|2|Yeah, that's true. Watch. And the tennis racket next to the TV, I mean,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_330381_332413.wav|2|for opening to disaster.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_334600_339410.wav|2|And then you have a small table over there and you have some art, maybe I think the statues
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_341281_344324.wav|2|Put them all or the both of them up on the.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_348189_364289.wav|2|That would be nice and also maybe together with this very classic book and you can put the book and they put a statue on the book that looks nice and another statue next to it and the plant looks great there. So just keep that and that will be a sort of like an.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_370440_376905.wav|2|Well, I think you can buy make this to a very light and beautiful and cozy room at the same time.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_381919_387227.wav|2|Oh God you have 2 tables as well. Your newspapers. Well
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_396100_409446.wav|2|Hmm, since you have that couch, and if you're having the couch in the corner, you have a lamp there to have somewhere to store newspapers, right? Next to it. So you can have a read in your couch, maybe you should have to get something or you can.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_412581_415189.wav|2|No, I I like that table more the, the bright.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_417321_422956.wav|2|That the other one wouldn't want is so dark. So I think maybe it makes it very dark in here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_425300_427821.wav|2|So, keep the couch with a bright.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_428400_430775.wav|2|Wooden table next to it and the lamp.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_222_003_main_432394_435370.wav|2|In that corner, and it will be your reading corner.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_39851_46017.wav|2|Yeah, I'm really, really satisfied with the plants in the the ceiling, how they're hanging from the ceiling.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_49237_53020.wav|2|Eh, no, I just like that they're three and they're hanging like symmetrically.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_55570_61816.wav|2|And also that there's a window both there and there, so you feel like an openness to the outside.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_63463_69867.wav|2|And also I have my little cozy corner over there and I can like have some tea and sit down.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_74983_77251.wav|2|Well, they're also three.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_77253_79286.wav|2|I like to have things in threes, right?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_79834_83705.wav|2|And uh, I just thought it was fun to put them that way.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_84475_86843.wav|2|Like it's not, it's unconventional.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_90042_92893.wav|2|So you get aware of
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_105752_108389.wav|2|It looks like a baby, but it will grow bigger, I think.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_112801_117370.wav|2|But it does look a bit like a baby, but it's still big, like it's so thin in a way.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_120739_122960.wav|2|Yeah, and I think, and I bought this new couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_138816_142094.wav|2|Yeah, one of them is actually it looks like it's glowing, which is weird.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_143701_148585.wav|2|The left one, it's like it's glowing in the dark, like there's a light inside it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_149104_151733.wav|2|I don't know how it got like that, but it's fun.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_156433_164697.wav|2|I think I put a blanket over there, a black blanket, which is a bit confusing cause it it looks a bit like there's a hole there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_166474_168606.wav|2|But that's fixable.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_171513_178039.wav|2|And also I I, that is a gift from a friend, the statue right behind you, right in front of you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_183561_187161.wav|2|Someone thought this would be this will be the place for naked man, I guess.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_194412_199593.wav|2|Yeah, well, I think she thinks she wishes me more men in my life.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_206126_208245.wav|2|I have to have it there so she won't be sad.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_209927_216453.wav|2|Well, it's it's an old painting, old house, horses.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_217371_221454.wav|2|You know, it's something from her grandmother.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_225012_227794.wav|2|It's something that wouldn't be, doesn't belong here really, but.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_231388_235914.wav|2|Well, the flower one is my favorite with all the white and yellow flowers.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_236294_239413.wav|2|And it goes so well together with the plants hanging there on the roof.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_240042_242359.wav|2|And also that one is also nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_242363_247821.wav|2|I think I I enjoy paintings with nature on them and the tree painting over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_248915_252263.wav|2|Or it's actually a photo of a tree.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_290047_299983.wav|2|See, I have the light and I can have my book and there's a table so I can have like eh eh a cup of tea or some wine and I can read something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_302532_307226.wav|2|Yeah, that might be true, though, but then I can use one of the pillows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_309511_311788.wav|2|I don't know about the waste bin over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_311867_315779.wav|2|That's like still here from when I was fixing the place.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_323606_327283.wav|2|Oh, yeah, it's because I enjoy tea so much.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_342495_344587.wav|2|But there's one on the floors.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_352408_357544.wav|2|I do have several in the kitchen as well, but those those are for looking for, I mean, looking at.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_359875_364156.wav|2|And it's so nice with the fffoot the coosh foot cushion.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_366640_368682.wav|2|You sit down and you put your feet up.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_379195_382768.wav|2|I bought it for this apartment cause I thought it matched.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_416111_418520.wav|2|Yeah, we'll go to the kitchen and make some tea.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_001_main_93430_95780.wav|2|the room space in that direction as well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_14986_22899.wav|2|Yes, and I'm still unpacking. You see I have all these boxes out, but this view is just amazing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_23500_26386.wav|2|And also, I have my Bears with me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_31200_41803.wav|2|Well, yeah, that one is that one I got from my grandparents when I was little so I uh always keep that and that one is for my baby to come. Yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_46000_54500.wav|2|Well, in 5 months so it's quite a long time still, but I did put lots of keys on the table, that's good, that's bad luck.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_58600_60615.wav|2|Could I haven't even learned, I don't know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_61000_64349.wav|2|Well, that's my key car keys. But the other one, the red one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_65800_68182.wav|2|I don't know. It must go to something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_70664_73000.wav|2|Don't you do you recognize them the red one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_78000_84665.wav|2|Well, and then I have my favorite couch. It's quite old. I I really want to get a new one but I got these new pillows though.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_85700_87866.wav|2|Purple purple, white. Nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_96600_98732.wav|2|I had this course last year.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_99200_104716.wav|2|Where I made vases. So that's basically what I know to do. The vase form.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_106800_112949.wav|2|Um I think the clear blue one that's my favorite color.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_114400_116466.wav|2|What's on the shelf?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_120300_123099.wav|2|And then that horse up there with no head.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_123800_127932.wav|2|It fell off. I know I know. But I mean, it fell off in the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_139600_142100.wav|2|So it's our TV sofa.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_145000_147749.wav|2|Oh, I have a room here, too, I forgot.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_151500_153545.wav|2|Here's my desk and uh,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_156300_159573.wav|2|it's a bit messy there, still. I haven't we and I need a chair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_162200_166168.wav|2|Exactly. And you know what? I'm thinking to have one of those. Um,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_172200_177914.wav|2|No, no chair. And I'm thinking that's good for your back right to sit on those.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_197100_199342.wav|2|As a gift from a relative.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_200500_203125.wav|2|It's old. It's been in our family a long time.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_204000_206619.wav|2|What sort of black and white? I think, maybe
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_208721_210880.wav|2|Is it from something? From the Bible?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_215600_221041.wav|2|Do you know I've seen it my entire life so I haven't really thought of what it is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_222500_225757.wav|2|And then this one, I love.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_232100_235308.wav|2|Uh, bit of mountains and also.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_241800_247782.wav|2|Swedish. I know it's called zeppelinare. I don't know. The word in English. Yeah. Zeppelin is that the word?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_251600_255640.wav|2|Such a picture of freedom in a way, they're just gliding there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_260600_263971.wav|2|uh, yeah, I should probably put something in the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_271200_277191.wav|2|A similar one over the in that corner behind that chair with the panda.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_280362_283063.wav|2|Yeah, that would be nice with the lamp over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_287100_292800.wav|2|Pop up pop out like this. Like it would be several lamps, you know, in one, Maybe.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_295000_302984.wav|2|But this is messy. I have to take those boxes away. Maybe you can take them with you when you leave, that would be I have two boxes over here by the way.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_305000_315594.wav|2|Well I would love it for you to take both. You can just put the small one in the big one and take them and throw them on your way. That would be so helpful. Thank you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_316900_320694.wav|2|And of course I will be sitting over there. I really like how the light shines in
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_336478_340178.wav|2|Well then I'll just have to turn that light off.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_342121_345158.wav|2|You are getting a lot of light in your face. Where's that coming from?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_348823_352986.wav|2|It's like yeah, I don't know like their looks like you're in the Sun.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_357400_362943.wav|2|Yeah, but that is a problem, of course, that lamp will have to be turned off when I watch TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_369300_374508.wav|2|No, that's probably mine that one. Don't you have yours like in your purse.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_378600_383922.wav|2|And the, what's that red thing? I mean the looks like a credit card but I don't think it is.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_391500_395051.wav|2|But I did have movers here, maybe some of them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_400050_402451.wav|2|I wonder if there's anything else back here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_001_main_410200_412779.wav|2|Well, it's almost settled.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_27846_30459.wav|2|Beautiful with the windows and the view there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_33974_36831.wav|2|Cramped like a lot of furniture in a small space.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_39371_42487.wav|2|Well, I think maybe one should
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_44632_46902.wav|2|since this couch is,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_50423_53489.wav|2|and a chair, right? And we can put that over in that corner?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_54466_58417.wav|2|And one can be... the long one can be... the couch can be that way and then the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_62115_64262.wav|2|I think that would open up this space.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_65059_67328.wav|2|Or actually, it would also be beautiful.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_68944_72552.wav|2|To put the couch and chair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_78268_82492.wav|2|And then you would just take the couch like that and have the chair there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_91803_97568.wav|2|Bureau, I don't even know. I forgot the name of it... but this huge furniture.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_103420_112055.wav|2|I'm thinking but if yeah, cuz if we would put the couch and chair there facing the fireplace, the desk would be turned that way.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_116884_119066.wav|2|Area for riding and stuff over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_119829_128428.wav|2|And then this, yeah, I think maybe this big furniture would have to go over there. So there's desk. There's the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_136070_143134.wav|2|The bureau! Let's call it a bureau. It's not really but that's the name right now. So desk, bureau and the couch
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_144306_151052.wav|2|And that also opens up for the window and then this pss table, I just think maybe get rid of that big table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_152001_158442.wav|2|Cause it's too big for this room because it's a sofa table, right? But it's too big of a sofa table for such a small space.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_162688_173508.wav|2|Well that also cause it's nice to have like a couch and then a chair next to it so you ah can you can be several people. You can like almost face each other a little bit or you can watch the fire
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_175127_178017.wav|2|Then there's this situation with the TV over there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_180457_184814.wav|2|Then it's possible to just sit in the couch or the chair to watch the TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_191610_193666.wav|2|I think that one goes really well there
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_196187_198551.wav|2|it's such a big painting and it's
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_203138_208618.wav|2|I think maybe these two are a little off, the one with the cows and the pilgrims and the desert.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_209523_213763.wav|2|Um, I'm thinking actually that one with a black frame
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_214786_218176.wav|2|Cause they go together in that way that that they both have black frames.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_218898_228310.wav|2|If the desk were to be under that, that would look much more like one piece of furniture, go together quite well, I think, with the dark desk and the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_229298_235364.wav|2|Dark framed painting. Ehm. that bu- but I think maybe you should just get rid of those two.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_236836_240083.wav|2|And maybe have like flowers or something, on top of the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_242972_246412.wav|2|maybe like the vases maybe they could be on top of the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_247047_249368.wav|2|fireplace and have like fresh flowers in them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_251382_255149.wav|2|Well, the the three vases placed over there cause it looks
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_256460_260893.wav|2|don't be offended but it looks a little bit like a museum over there over here with
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_275118_281423.wav|2|But if I were to suggest something, it would be to loosen it up a little bit.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_282328_284627.wav|2|And also this small table with a plant.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_285286_287662.wav|2|Maybe that could be a sofa table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_290181_293214.wav|2|Cause it's nice to have something to put a cup or a glass, you know?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_301238_304734.wav|2|Well, I actually like how the lights.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_307953_310701.wav|2|It's q-quite nice cu-cause they dim also, I guess.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_312426_318789.wav|2|And that lamp I think should be over there'n that corner, rather than there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_320231_322914.wav|2|By the desk. Exactly. I think that would be nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_333964_340447.wav|2|Well, you have two, and I mean I'm you don't need the blue one, I guess. The blue one looks very much like it's a
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_344724_353580.wav|2|And this is your home, not a recycle center, but you do have the wipe in and that goes fine together with the desk. And actually I didn't see it at first so which is a good thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_363345_367219.wav|2|I think maybe in the middle here you should have like a big plant or something.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_368138_371186.wav|2|Like that, that would go together nice with the windows and the lights.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_209_003_main_83006_85629.wav|2|This will have to find another space.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_25300_32200.wav|2|Yes, I will try. Let's see here. So we have couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_32900_36484.wav|2|We have sofa table TV.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_39000_47144.wav|2|Another and a chair, those go really good together, the lamp and the armchair, I think they should be.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_50000_56726.wav|2|Is it almost looks like they're bought together and also that one. I mean the table that the TV lies on
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_61200_64911.wav|2|So, maybe we should start with just moving the lamp.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_76600_81100.wav|2|Let me think, I don't know about the cow.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_85399_89447.wav|2|That you have one, you have a big couch, big brown, and black couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_93300_98196.wav|2|Put like another fabric around it, because it looks quite old.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_98900_103192.wav|2|This brown and black Fabric and also, I don't know about the pillows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_103700_108669.wav|2|I think maybe you should move it, the purple and white pillows to the armchair
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_109852_111939.wav|2|Cuz they don't really go together with that fabric.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_116737_119014.wav|2|let me think.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_134264_136624.wav|2|And uh, then you move the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_137309_151232.wav|2|Table with a TV on it to this side instead because they have like that table, the lamp and the chair, they go together, nicely you take this sofa and put that on that wall instead.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_152742_159942.wav|2|Keep the plant over there because it, it will be nice. Oh, I know, uh, sorry the big plants. The big palm tree
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_161052_177652.wav|2|Uh, well actually, you can put that next to the other plant, the smaller plants, so you have them next to each other. That will be nice. And so, the couch goes over there recycling bin place it somewhere else, like maybe kitchen or something. Because right now, it looks misplaced.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_178895_181174.wav|2|So, you have lamp armchair
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_182089_186317.wav|2|TV couch over there. This I don't know about that really.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_193689_196309.wav|2|At some sort of bookshelf, I guess.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_199837_202462.wav|2|The sofa table and the the rug,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_212012_216439.wav|2|Maybe an idea would be to put the shelves.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_217197_219529.wav|2|Over here like straight in front of the window.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_221400_226777.wav|2|Cuz then you will get light shining through and also the light will be nice looking in the voses.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_227297_229736.wav|2|So you the colors would pop out.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_243247_247347.wav|2|So, if the TV's there, that has to be moved because the TV will be there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_251900_255059.wav|2|Uh, the this old black and white one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_260500_265899.wav|2|That it has a black frame that goes together well with the other furniture with black in them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_266922_271036.wav|2|uh, but there's a TV there, so maybe
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_274100_285900.wav|2|Just move that along or wait, actually, that one is looks better with a couch. So place that painting above the couch over there, this one goes over there that wall
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_301500_305292.wav|2|What did we say? Still there? That's right. Um,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_314227_316562.wav|2|Maybe you should have a lamp in the ceiling here as well.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_319379_324569.wav|2|Maybe you can have like a similar one. That makes the two rooms go together nicely.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_003_main_333844_339014.wav|2|You're welcome. Good luck with your apartment and get rid of the T. Teddy bear. Get rid of
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_25524_28433.wav|2|But they're all stuck though. I mean the things are there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_37494_39660.wav|2|yeah, but it's been like that the entire time
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_40352_42719.wav|2|Like the pinkies. I don't know what's happening with them.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_81763_84024.wav|2|Yeah, but I can't do any... it's it's straight now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_84552_86952.wav|2|But it's been looking like that the whole time.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_90652_92952.wav|2|I don't know why because the thing is right.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_120097_123380.wav|2|But there used to be two more vases over there. Where are they?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_127883_130191.wav|2|Well, six is a good number. Why didn't you keep them?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_137800_144194.wav|2|So uh where... Did you clean the rug? Eh? Yeah, of course. Okay. Good.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_144883_148235.wav|2|And what about that waste bin over there? What's that doing there?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_159666_162566.wav|2|please bring that with you because I don't want that there. Thank you.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_171915_173996.wav|2|no, but the one i- used to be over there,
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_183739_185790.wav|2|Okay, but could you please put it back though?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_186604_192404.wav|2|To where it was. Yeah, did you take any pictures of how it was? When when I when you moved in?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_197648_201348.wav|2|Oh God. Why did you leave keys on the table? It's bad luck.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_204400_206783.wav|2|It's very much bad luck. Yes.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_211504_213743.wav|2|You should keep them in your pocket or on a...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_225046_228546.wav|2|Don't put keys on the table. It's very bad luck.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_229462_238662.wav|2|So, I hope you get that bad luck. If, if it's something, doesn't stay in the apartment. Good. You have to take. So, take everything. That's your credit card as well, I guess, cuz that's not mine.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_265262_267465.wav|2|No, I don't want the panda. You take the panda.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_269502_272097.wav|2|What's the why did you buy those?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_282076_285337.wav|2|No, I guess you should just give them to someone who has children.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_289046_291644.wav|2|I think they're a bit scary Panda and Teddy.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_292273_297973.wav|2|No, thank you. So what I want you to bring with you is this recycling bin, teddy, panda!
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_304017_306017.wav|2|painting over there and the vases.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_211_002_main_321862_324772.wav|2|By the TV and also one in the window.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_24166_26215.wav|2|Well, we'll try to change that then.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_29548_33219.wav|2|Couch, chair, foot piece, other chair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_34932_37285.wav|2|Plants, you a lot of plants, which is nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_38601_44371.wav|2|And also two beautiful windows facing different directions, which is nice. You will have sunlight coming in...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_50242_56651.wav|2|I would like to put, I would like to make this corner... the couch corner.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_57851_64072.wav|2|So we would put the couch there and this big, beautiful chair over by that wall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_65178_69023.wav|2|And also, of course, the foot piece would go along with the couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_69355_73410.wav|2|So then you have a view over the entire space, which is nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_76063_79037.wav|2|There's a big foot couch that goes with the couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_85746_89672.wav|2|Well the TV is right there now which I think...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_102053_105328.wav|2|or maybe we should have like the couch there
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_107900_110058.wav|2|and you could have the tv thing here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_112144_119017.wav|2|I think I would like this area to be sort of the lounge area, and over there it could be bit lighter.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_120433_129184.wav|2|So, okay, so this is my suggestion. The big couch there, the ch- the big chair there, which makes it like an L, sort of.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_130888_139286.wav|2|We move the entire TV and table, or the bureau, and stands on over here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_141034_145835.wav|2|And then, I mean, we would have to pull the rug, I think, so the rug is with the couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_146919_149834.wav|2|So that leaves us with a great, like, big space here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_151373_154979.wav|2|And then we can put the small table and the other chair...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_159318_161356.wav|2|Mm. Well, there's a small armchair.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_161596_166700.wav|2|There's a huge armchair that goes with the couch, and there's a small armchair that looks a bit...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_170734_173052.wav|2|Yeah, which is cool, cool detail.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_173803_182525.wav|2|And I also, I really like how these things go together with the small table and the small armchair and also the palm tree.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_183676_187840.wav|2|So maybe we can put them like in that corner over there together...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_188389_192732.wav|2|since there's lot of plants and stuff going on over there, it can be like a jungle corner.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_202590_206234.wav|2|So what do you think about that? Like jungle corner, lounge area...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_216824_223674.wav|2|Well, maybe they should have like, wouldn't it be cool to have like pillars for each one?
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_224473_226904.wav|2|And maybe they could be over like by that wall.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_231498_235698.wav|2|Well, on a pillar. I mean, if the... because there's a black one and a light one.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_237637_243868.wav|2|And if you have pillars, maybe in different levels, that could look sort of cool.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_244483_248507.wav|2|Actually, maybe they should be over in that corner between the windows.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_258777_261945.wav|2|It's right by the TV now, which is not a good place for it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_263293_266146.wav|2|Yeah, it's danger... disturbs also the TV watching.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_267647_272015.wav|2|So we can have jungle corner and then we can have a bit and we have two statues and maybe...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_275226_277232.wav|2|It's uh right there on the...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_281873_286528.wav|2|Well, y- you should probably have when you have like the couch and the
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_288046_291004.wav|2|The chair here, there's a sm- you have a small table also in...
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_291154_294081.wav|2|also always put the remote on that table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_309917_315767.wav|2|Yeah, but I mean, there's a there's a white white box next to the TV thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_322437_326242.wav|2|Remove that, because it's it's just messy looking.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_326741_330042.wav|2|Oh, you have that furniture as well, with the kettles on it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_343423_348158.wav|2|So maybe it's the jungle wall, not just jungle corner.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_350677_352876.wav|2|Lounge area jungle room, that's nice.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_358114_362734.wav|2|towards the outside, I think... because that's a door I think, yeah
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_363259_368040.wav|2|so then you can... it's nice to have plants next to there because also you can have some plants outside
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_368666_372256.wav|2|and it sort of connects the inside and the outside in a nice way.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_404737_409886.wav|2|Well, I I suggest having a pillar for every item and then putting them
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_410676_413942.wav|2|together in some formation. I think that would be cool.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_417966_424771.wav|2|Well, yeah, maybe like the museum area, let's call it, should be here where the TV is now.
data/mm-conv/hsi_4_0717_210_003_main_425219_430806.wav|2|And then there's a jungle area, sort of we can call it like art, art area.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_89906_97862.wav|1|Yeah, yeah, with the stove and... But I did... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_006_main_456870_464194.wav|1|I just, I had this really nice garbage, eh, holder, but, ehm, it fell.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_227098_230700.wav|1|yeah he he he, Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh umm
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_011_main_489654_492616.wav|1|You know, it has to, doesn't has to be sitting very close.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_210_010_main_395311_400836.wav|1|and swe, sweaters, eh, easily without a ladder, you know.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_003_main_130380_132598.wav|1|This, this, up there,
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_209_008_main_371018_375624.wav|1|Okay, then I want to see it cleaned for uh tonight.
data/mm-conv/hsi_3_0715_227_004_main_303017_309810.wav|1|And we have to put up the painting a little bit higher, so it doesn't it's become too close to the table.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_63290_66139.wav|5|So the plushies are really, really important for me.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_main_474792_477306.wav|5|You know, it's a it's a it's a it's a real problem.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_22464_31450.wav|5|So that's good. The the carpet seems to be clean, which is good because this carpet is really hard to clean. So you did a great job there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_213187_218527.wav|5|And you reported that uh one of the statues uh fell while you were here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_210_003_main_267903_271011.wav|5|and uh the procedures you use for cleaning them
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_180847_186334.wav|5|I I don't understand how you, I I mean, this is so... unrespectful from you, really.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_004_main_279039_282682.wav|5|The carpet was a little bit... closer to the couch.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_main_351460_354143.wav|5|I think, yeah, you should keep a maximum of two.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_004_main_400541_409080.wav|5|So because I think here you have a situation in which the paint is taking too much attention from the TV, and you want more directed attention there.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_276685_279945.wav|5|I really like to to enjoy looking at it.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_001_main_398422_402594.wav|5|So, you know, it's a little bit more of a versatility ah thing.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_111620_115153.wav|5|It was a nice add-on, but it's not my piece of cake, really.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_222_002_main_360108_365760.wav|5|Yeah, I mean, it's not that spacious this room. Maybe this is not the accurate room to have those here.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_227_002_inter_705500_711872.wav|6|Yeah, with the plants. But does it have a special... bulb for the... plant or is it just a simple... lamp?
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_003_inter_266427_270862.wav|6|Ah I was also wondering about the paintings. I think it's too much, maybe.
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_209_003_inter_69433_75941.wav|6|But if you go back to the maybe furni- furniture coloring, so can you give a mice by piece piece by piece, what do you think would be a good color?
data/mm-conv/hsi_7_0719_211_002_inter_289553_291847.wav|6|It's a bit short, your room, low?
data/mm-conv/hsi_6_0718_209_001_inter_40859_48169.wav|6|Getting that uh-huh? Okay. Uh so I will just get back and then we can you can show me your new apartment.
data/mm-conv/hsi_5_0718_209_002_main_137387_140168.wav|3|but eh there's nothing I can't change because uh...
