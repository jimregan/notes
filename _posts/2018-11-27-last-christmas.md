For Christmas, the school insisted that we get the students to sing
a song, and record it for their parents. So, with older students,
we generally let them pick the song themselves.

I had two all-girl groups, and both chose "Last Christmas" - fine by
me, one set of notes. It also ended up being the song chosen by a
group of mainly boys, because their other teacher foolishly
mentioned that, having spent a Christmas working in retail in
England, she really hated that song. Which I mentioned to them.
Next lesson, she walked in to a serenade of "Last Christmas",
and immediately came across to the office to ask if I might
know why that had happened.

**Very**

We most often see "very" as an adverb which intensifies an adjective:
very dark, very wet, etc., but it can also be used as an adjective
meaning "the same" or "identical": he left that *very* night.

**Once bitten, twice shy**

This is a proverb that means that if you've been hurt by something once,
you'll be more careful the next time.

It's an example of *elliptical causation*: *if* once bitten, *then*
twice shy: that is, the *causation* (if... then...) is omitted: this
kind of omission is known as an *ellipsis*, which is also the name given
to the triple dots (...) used to show a piece of a quotation has been
omitted.

Other examples of elliptical causation include "no pain, no gain",
"waste not, want not", "nothing ventured, nothing gained".

**Gave**: not that, unlike the standard pronunciation *(gejw)*, George
Michael pronounces it as *gew* throughout. This is typical of a number
of accents in England. (He pronounces "save" in a similar manner.)

**To catch s.b.'s eye**: to capture someone's attention.

**A shoulder to cry on**: a person who is prepared to listen to someone
else's problems

**Undercover**: in secret; spying.

**With a fire in one's heart**: to be very passionate about something
