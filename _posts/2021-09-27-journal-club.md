# Introduction

> Speech and language impairments are indeed salient characteristics of MCI and early AD [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637404/full#:~:text=Speech%20and%20language%20impairments%20are%20indeed%20salient%20characteristics%20of%20MCI%20and%20early%20AD)

> However, the cognitive and structural underpinnings of these speech-based

> AD speech is characterized by slower speech rate (global speed of speech
> including pauses), a higher number of silent pauses, longer pauses and
> shorter interpausal units (or chunks of speech bounded by silent pauses [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637404/full#:~:text=AD%20speech%20is%20characterized%20by%20slower%20speech%20rate%20(global%20speed%20of%20speech%20including%20pauses)%2C%20a%20higher%20number%20of%20silent%20pauses%2C%20longer%20pauses%20and%20shorter%20interpausal%20units%20(or%20chunks%20of%20speech%20bounded%20by%20silent%20pauses)
