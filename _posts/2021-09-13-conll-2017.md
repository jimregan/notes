[CoNLL 2017 Shared Task - Automatically Annotated Raw Texts and Word Embeddings](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-1989)

There was a web page with raw text; the Irish data has some stuff that
looks weird. There are items that look like they were poorly split, but
there are items from [Logos Poetry](http://www.logospoetry.org/document.php?document_id=399&code_language=GA&sequencer=44895)
like this:

> 41\] Ná tréig neamh ar ní nach lat;

where the line numbering and brace were intentional. Not that there aren't
odd splits because of poor sentence splitting. The sentence at line 4467
of `ga-common_crawl-000.conllu.xz` is:

> do giallaibh) .i. tech lán do ghiallaibh aigi.

which comes from [here](https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G503002/text142.html):

> Nó **Eochaid Domplén** .i. domus (.i. tech) plena (.i. do giallaibh) .i. tech lán do ghiallaibh aigi.
> Is de rohainmniged **Eochaid Domplén** de.

(i.e., it's not even modern Irish).
