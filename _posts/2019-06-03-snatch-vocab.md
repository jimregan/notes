description: My Friday morning student (advanced) wanted to watch a movie with genuine British accents, and slang. We arrived at "Snatch". I regretted it every time I had to do vocabulary notes. I cringed deeply when I found this; hopefully I'll find it again in the future, and experience the same cringe.

## "Snatch" vocabulary

Bust a cap in his ass: African-American slang. "Bust a cap" means to
shoot (a *cap* can be a small explosive used to set off a larger
explosive, especially in mining, so in slang, it's a bullet); *one's
ass* can be used as an emphatic replacement for a pronoun: "my ass is
tired", "he has to drag his ass to work". Possibly from *work one's ass
off* (to work to the point of fatigue).

Yardie: a Jamaican ("yard" in Jamaican Creole means "home"); more
specifically, a member of a Jamaican gang

Goody gumdrops (or goody goody gumdrops): childish expression of
happiness, usually sarcastic when used by adults.

Pisshead: person who regularly gets drunk. "Piss" can be used to mean
alcohol ("We're going on the piss" = "we're going drinking"); *-head*
can be used to form a noun (usually derogatory) for a person who's
dedicated to something: a *pothead* likes to smoke marijuana ("pot"), a
*metalhead* listens to heavy metal; it can also be added to other
insults to imply stupidity (*blockhead*, *shithead*).

Look like curry to a pisshead: curry is an extremely popular post-pub
food in Britain, so this is irresistible food.

Porky pies: rhyming slang for *lies*. Usually shortened to *porkies*.
