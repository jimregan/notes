## Software

Two types - Operating Systems, Applications

**O.S.** -- Set of instructions which control the computer --- MS DOS,
OS/2

**App.** -- Set of instructions to make computer perform specific
tasks

**Algorithm** -- set of instructions which lead to a solution

**Program** -- algorithm expressed in a language thaat a computer can
understand



Programs are all about data manipulation

- must be able to store data & instructions

- data and instructions stored in memory

Computer memory is a 2 state device -- think of one state as 1, other as
0 -- binary



Data and instructions are converted to binary using a coding
scheme

Schemes -- ASCII, EBCDIC



Programs are at levels, which depend on levels (how far away from the
machine)

- lowest -- machine code

- next -- assembler

- next -- higher level language



Binary programming is difficult. Solutions to problems (programs) are
usually written in English like structures called high level languages,
which are converted to machine code using a compiler.

1. Source program (Pascal Statement)

2. Compiler

3. Object Program (Machine Language)
