	abstract = {Speech produced by children is characterized by a high fundamental frequency which complicates measurement of vocal tract resonances, and hence coarticulation. Here two whole-spectrum measures of coarticulation are validated, one temporal and one spectral, that are less sensitive to these challenges. Using these measures, consonant-vowel coarticulation is calculated in the speech of a large sample of 4-year-old children. The measurements replicate known lingual coarticulatory findings from the literature, demonstrating the utility of these acoustic measures of coarticulation in speakers of all ages.},

	abstract = {End-to-end models have achieved impressive results on the task of automatic speech recognition (ASR). For low-resource ASR tasks, however, labeled data can hardly satisfy the demand of end-to-end models. Self-supervised acoustic pre-training has already shown its amazing ASR performance, while the transcription is still inadequate for language modeling in end-to-end models. In this work, we fuse a pre-trained acoustic encoder (wav2vec2.0) and a pre-trained linguistic encoder (BERT) into an end-to-end ASR model. The fused model only needs to learn the transfer from speech to language during fine-tuning on limited labeled data. The length of the two modalities is matched by a monotonic attention mechanism without additional parameters. Besides, a fully connected layer is introduced for the hidden mapping between modalities. We further propose a scheduled fine-tuning strategy to preserve and utilize the text context modeling ability of the pre-trained linguistic encoder. Experiments show our effective utilizing of pre-trained modules. Our model achieves better recognition performance on CALLHOME corpus (15 hours) than other end-to-end models.},

Phone recognition in TIMIT has more than two decades of intense research behind it and its performance has naturally improved with time. There is a full array of systems, but with regard to evaluation they concentrate on three domains: phone segmentation, phone classification and phone recognition.},

An interesting question is whether this trend will continue-are there any clear failure cases for E2E training? We study this question in depth, for the specific case of E2E training an ensemble of networks. Our strategy is to blend the gradient smoothly in between two extremes: from independent training of the networks, up to to full E2E training. We find clear failure cases, where over-parameterized models cannot be trained E2E. A surprising result is that the optimum can sometimes lie in between the two, neither an ensemble or an E2E system. The work also uncovers links to Dropout, and raises questions around the nature of ensemble diversity and multi-branch networks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07447},
	abstract = {Self-supervised approaches for speech representation learning are challenged by three unique problems: (1) there are multiple sound units in each input utterance, (2) there is no lexicon of input sound units during the pre-training phase, and (3) sound units have variable lengths with no explicit segmentation. To deal with these three problems, we propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs. HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h, 10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets. Using a 1B parameter model, HuBERT shows up to 19\% and 13\% relative WER reduction on the more challenging dev-other and test-other evaluation subsets.},

	abstract = {Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models have recently shown very promising results on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, which integrate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model into a single neural network. In these models, the Transformer, a new sequence-to-sequence attention-based model relying entirely on self-attention without using RNNs or convolutions, achieves a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU on neural machine translation (NMT) tasks. Since the outstanding performance of the Transformer, we extend it to speech and concentrate on it as the basic architecture of sequence-to-sequence attention-based model on Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks. Furthermore, we investigate a comparison between syllable based model and context-independent phoneme (CI-phoneme) based model with the Transformer in Mandarin Chinese. Additionally, a greedy cascading decoder with the Transformer is proposed for mapping CI-phoneme sequences and syllable sequences into word sequences. Experiments on HKUST datasets demonstrate that syllable based model with the Transformer performs better than CI-phoneme based counterpart, and achieves a character error rate (CER) of {\textbackslash}emph\{\$28.77{\textbackslash}\%\$\}, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art CER of \$28.0{\textbackslash}\%\$ by the joint CTC-attention based encoder-decoder network.},

We also evaluate the benefit of using auxiliary language information obtained on-the-fly from an acoustic LID classifier. Experiments with the English-Hindi language pair show that: (a) multi-task architectures perform better overall, and (b) the best joint architecture surpasses monolingual ASR (6.4–9.2\% word error rate reduction) and acoustic LID (53.9–56.1\% error rate reduction) baselines while reducing the overall memory footprint by up to 46\%.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for CS ASR using E2E connectionist temporal classification (CTC) models. We use a frame-level language identification model to linearly adjust the posteriors of an E2E CTC model. We evaluate the proposed method on Microsoft live Chinese Cortana data with 7000 hours Chinese and English monolingual data and 300 hours CS data as the training data. Trained with only monolingual data without observing any CS data, the proposed method can obtain up to 6.3\% relative word error rate (WER) reduction. In the scenario of training with both monolingual and CS data, the proposed method can get up to 4.2\% relative WER improvement. This approach can also maintain comparable performance on a Chinese test set compared with baseline models.},

	abstract = {Code-Switching (CS) remains a challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially character-based models. With the combined choice of characters from multiple languages, the outcome from character-based models suffers from phoneme duplication, resulting in language-inconsistent spellings. We propose Contextualized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CCTC) loss to encourage spelling consistencies of a character-based non-autoregressive ASR which allows for faster inference. The CCTC loss conditions the main prediction on the predicted contexts to ensure language consistency in the spellings. In contrast to existing CTC-based approaches, CCTC loss does not require frame-level alignments, since the context ground truth is obtained from the model's estimated path. Compared to the same model trained with regular CTC loss, our method consistently improved the ASR performance on both CS and monolingual corpora.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new approach for audio-visual speech separation. Given a video, the goal is to extract the speech associated with a face in spite of simultaneous background sounds and/or other human speakers. Whereas existing methods focus on learning the alignment between the speaker's lip movements and the sounds they generate, we propose to leverage the speaker's face appearance as an additional prior to isolate the corresponding vocal qualities they are likely to produce. Our approach jointly learns audio-visual speech separation and cross-modal speaker embeddings from unlabeled video. It yields state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets for audio-visual speech separation and enhancement, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos of diverse scenarios.

	abstract = {Deep learning implementations on CPUs (Central Processing Units) are gaining more traction. Enhanced AI capabilities on commodity x86 architectures are commercially appealing due to the reuse of existing hardware and virtualization ease. A notable work in this direction is the SLIDE system. SLIDE is a C++ implementation of a sparse hash table based back-propagation, which was shown to be significantly faster than GPUs in training hundreds of million parameter neural models. In this paper, we argue that SLIDE's current implementation is sub-optimal and does not exploit several opportunities available in modern CPUs. In particular, we show how SLIDE's computations allow for a unique possibility of vectorization via AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)-512. Furthermore, we highlight opportunities for different kinds of memory optimization and quantizations. Combining all of them, we obtain up to 7x speedup in the computations on the same hardware. Our experiments are focused on large (hundreds of millions of parameters) recommendation and NLP models. Our work highlights several novel perspectives and opportunities for implementing randomized algorithms for deep learning on modern CPUs.

	abstract = {Most neural vocoders employ band-limited mel-spectrograms to generate waveforms. If full-band spectral features are used as the input, the vocoder can be provided with as much acoustic information as possible. However, in some models employing full-band mel-spectrograms, an over-smoothing problem occurs as part of which non-sharp spectrograms are generated. To address this problem, we propose UnivNet, a neural vocoder that synthesizes high-fidelity waveforms in real time. Inspired by works in the field of voice activity detection, we added a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator that employs multiple linear spectrogram magnitudes computed using various parameter sets. Using full-band mel-spectrograms as input, we expect to generate high-resolution signals by adding a discriminator that employs spectrograms of multiple resolutions as the input. In an evaluation on a dataset containing information on hundreds of speakers, UnivNet obtained the best objective and subjective results among competing models for both seen and unseen speakers. These results, including the best subjective score for text-to-speech, demonstrate the potential for fast adaptation to new speakers without a need for training from scratch.},
