	abstract = {End-to-end models have achieved impressive results on the task of automatic speech recognition (ASR). For low-resource ASR tasks, however, labeled data can hardly satisfy the demand of end-to-end models. Self-supervised acoustic pre-training has already shown its amazing ASR performance, while the transcription is still inadequate for language modeling in end-to-end models. In this work, we fuse a pre-trained acoustic encoder (wav2vec2.0) and a pre-trained linguistic encoder (BERT) into an end-to-end ASR model. The fused model only needs to learn the transfer from speech to language during fine-tuning on limited labeled data. The length of the two modalities is matched by a monotonic attention mechanism without additional parameters. Besides, a fully connected layer is introduced for the hidden mapping between modalities. We further propose a scheduled fine-tuning strategy to preserve and utilize the text context modeling ability of the pre-trained linguistic encoder. Experiments show our effective utilizing of pre-trained modules. Our model achieves better recognition performance on CALLHOME corpus (15 hours) than other end-to-end models.},

Phone recognition in TIMIT has more than two decades of intense research behind it and its performance has naturally improved with time. There is a full array of systems, but with regard to evaluation they concentrate on three domains: phone segmentation, phone classification and phone recognition.},

An interesting question is whether this trend will continue-are there any clear failure cases for E2E training? We study this question in depth, for the specific case of E2E training an ensemble of networks. Our strategy is to blend the gradient smoothly in between two extremes: from independent training of the networks, up to to full E2E training. We find clear failure cases, where over-parameterized models cannot be trained E2E. A surprising result is that the optimum can sometimes lie in between the two, neither an ensemble or an E2E system. The work also uncovers links to Dropout, and raises questions around the nature of ensemble diversity and multi-branch networks.},

	abstract = {Self-supervised approaches for speech representation learning are challenged by three unique problems: (1) there are multiple sound units in each input utterance, (2) there is no lexicon of input sound units during the pre-training phase, and (3) sound units have variable lengths with no explicit segmentation. To deal with these three problems, we propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs. HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h, 10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets. Using a 1B parameter model, HuBERT shows up to 19\% and 13\% relative WER reduction on the more challenging dev-other and test-other evaluation subsets.},

	abstract = {Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models have recently shown very promising results on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, which integrate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model into a single neural network. In these models, the Transformer, a new sequence-to-sequence attention-based model relying entirely on self-attention without using RNNs or convolutions, achieves a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU on neural machine translation (NMT) tasks. Since the outstanding performance of the Transformer, we extend it to speech and concentrate on it as the basic architecture of sequence-to-sequence attention-based model on Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks. Furthermore, we investigate a comparison between syllable based model and context-independent phoneme (CI-phoneme) based model with the Transformer in Mandarin Chinese. Additionally, a greedy cascading decoder with the Transformer is proposed for mapping CI-phoneme sequences and syllable sequences into word sequences. Experiments on HKUST datasets demonstrate that syllable based model with the Transformer performs better than CI-phoneme based counterpart, and achieves a character error rate (CER) of {\textbackslash}emph\{\$28.77{\textbackslash}\%\$\}, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art CER of \$28.0{\textbackslash}\%\$ by the joint CTC-attention based encoder-decoder network.},

We also evaluate the benefit of using auxiliary language information obtained on-the-fly from an acoustic LID classifier. Experiments with the English-Hindi language pair show that: (a) multi-task architectures perform better overall, and (b) the best joint architecture surpasses monolingual ASR (6.4–9.2\% word error rate reduction) and acoustic LID (53.9–56.1\% error rate reduction) baselines while reducing the overall memory footprint by up to 46\%.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for CS ASR using E2E connectionist temporal classification (CTC) models. We use a frame-level language identification model to linearly adjust the posteriors of an E2E CTC model. We evaluate the proposed method on Microsoft live Chinese Cortana data with 7000 hours Chinese and English monolingual data and 300 hours CS data as the training data. Trained with only monolingual data without observing any CS data, the proposed method can obtain up to 6.3\% relative word error rate (WER) reduction. In the scenario of training with both monolingual and CS data, the proposed method can get up to 4.2\% relative WER improvement. This approach can also maintain comparable performance on a Chinese test set compared with baseline models.},

	abstract = {Code-Switching (CS) remains a challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially character-based models. With the combined choice of characters from multiple languages, the outcome from character-based models suffers from phoneme duplication, resulting in language-inconsistent spellings. We propose Contextualized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CCTC) loss to encourage spelling consistencies of a character-based non-autoregressive ASR which allows for faster inference. The CCTC loss conditions the main prediction on the predicted contexts to ensure language consistency in the spellings. In contrast to existing CTC-based approaches, CCTC loss does not require frame-level alignments, since the context ground truth is obtained from the model's estimated path. Compared to the same model trained with regular CTC loss, our method consistently improved the ASR performance on both CS and monolingual corpora.},

	abstract = {Automatic syllabification of words is challenging, not least because the syllable is not easy to define precisely. Consequently, no accepted standard algorithm for automatic syllabification exists. There are two broad approaches: rule-based and data-driven. The rule-based method effectively embodies some theoretical position regarding the syllable, whereas the data-driven paradigm tries to infer “new” syllabifications from examples assumed to be correctly syllabified already. This article compares the performance of several variants of the two basic approaches. Given the problems of definition, it is difficult to determine a correct syllabification in all cases and so to establish the quality of the “gold standard” corpus used either to evaluate quantitatively the output of an automatic algorithm or as the example-set on which data-driven methods crucially depend. Thus, we look for consensus in the entries in multiple lexical databases of pre-syllabified words. In this work, we have used two independent lexicons, and extracted from them the same 18,016 words with their corresponding (possibly different) syllabifications. We have also created a third lexicon corresponding to the 13,594 words that share the same syllabifications in these two sources. As well as two rule-based approaches (Hammond's and Fisher's implementation of Kahn's), three data-driven techniques are evaluated: a look-up procedure, an exemplar-based generalization technique, and syllabification by analogy (SbA). The results on the three databases show consistent and robust patterns. First, the data-driven techniques outperform the rule-based systems in word and juncture accuracies by a very significant margin but require training data and are slower. Second, syllabification in the pronunciation domain is easier than in the spelling domain. Finally, best results are consistently obtained with SbA.},

LE-SR was tested on NTC2, a 20,000 English word pronouncing dictionary. The ten-fold accuracy ranged from 94.55\% to 96.05\% for words and 96.81\% to 97.71\% for syllables.The frequency of the rule usage indicates that most of the syllabification (86.21\%) in NTC2 is covered by only 0.64\% of the syllabification rules produced by LE-SR, while exceptions (2.45\%) require 76.77\% of the syllabification rules. This experimental result is consistent with the linguistics literature. Relatively few rules cover the vast majority of cases, but a considerable number of exceptions must be handled individually.The learned rules can be used to divide any English word into syllables. Based on syllables, the English stress rules can be learned. Syllabification and stress greatly influence the naturalness of the output of a text-to-speech system. Existing text-to-speech systems have either obtained syllabification from a dictionary or used a few hand coded rules. Using machine learning approach to obtain these rules is a step towards producing natural speech sounding for text-to-speech systems.},

Participants were required to repeat bisyllabic words such as “fourmi” (ant) by inserting a pause between its two syllabic components (/fur/-/mi/). In the first experiment we tested segmentation over a range of 49 double intervocalic consonant clusters. A similar general segmentation behavior was observed in both age groups, with a pattern that fit the predictions from a legality principle-based model of syllabification. Experiment 2 revealed that opacity between phonological and orthographic representations lead to increased ambisyllabic responses and a reduction in segmentation consistency in adults. In total, these findings indicate that syllabic forms are consistently represented from an early age, but that segmentation in metalinguistic tasks is susceptible to contamination from spelling and etymological knowledge.},

In recent years, partly in reaction to Chomsky's and Halle's neglect of it in The sound pattern of English, much work has been done to incorporate the syllable into phonological theory (Anderson \& Jones, 1974; Bailey, 1978; Hoard, 1971; Hooper, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1978; Kahn, 1976; Pulgram, 1970; Rudes, 1977; Vennemann, 1972).Syllable theories have been based on evidence from phonetics, phonological processes, prosody, language change, child language acquisition, and language universals. The purpose of this experimental study is (a) to contribute empirical evidence about the nature of the syllable from native speakers' actual syllabifications of words and (b) to determine how this evidence reflects on the syllable theories already proposed.Syllable studies have focused on two major questions: (1) what is the structure of the syllable and (2) how are words divided into syllables (syllabified). These questions are obviously related, and the answers to each have implications for the other. This study was designed to elicit data directly addressing both questions.},

However, conventional multistage approaches, which rely on a pipeline of training hidden Markov models (HMM)-GMM models and tree-building steps still give the state-of-the-art results on most databases. In this study, we investigate flat-start one-stage training of neural networks using lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) objective function with HMM for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. We thoroughly look into different issues that arise in such a setup and propose a standalone system, which achieves word error rates (WER) comparable with that of the state-of-the-art multi-stage systems while being much faster to prepare. We propose to use full biphones to enable flat-start context-dependent (CD) modeling and show through experiments that our CD modeling approach can be almost as effective as regular tree-based CD modeling. We show that our flat-start LF-MMI setup together with this tree-free CD modeling technique achieves 10 to 25 \% relative WER reduction compared to other end-to-end methods on well-known databases. The improvements are larger for smaller databases.},

	abstract = {The identification of syllables within phonetic sequences is known as syllabification. This task is thought to play an important role in natural language understanding, speech production, and the development of speech recognition systems. The concept of the syllable is cross-linguistic, though formal definitions are rarely agreed upon, even within a language. In response, data-driven syllabification methods have been developed to learn from syllabified examples. These methods often employ classical machine learning sequence labeling models. In recent years, recurrence-based neural networks have been shown to perform increasingly well for sequence labeling tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging, and chunking. We present a novel approach to the syllabification problem which leverages modern neural network techniques. Our network is constructed with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, a convolutional component, and a conditional random field (CRF) output layer. Existing syllabification approaches are rarely evaluated across multiple language families. To demonstrate cross-linguistic generalizability, we show that the network is competitive with state of the art systems in syllabifying English, Dutch, Italian, French, Manipuri, and Basque datasets.},

We demonstrate that the latter can be implemented with finite state transducers. We experiment with phones and context dependent HMM states as acoustic modeling units. We also investigate the effect of context in acoustic input by training unidirectional and bidirectional LSTM RNN models. We show that a bidirectional LSTM RNN CTC model using phone units can perform as well as an LSTM RNN model trained with CE using HMM state alignments.

For A. C. Gimson the syllable is relevant mainly as a possible phonetic category or as a category to which phonotactic constraints may be referred. He is sceptical of the first, and for the second prefers the word. Yet English has a fair number of important allophonic rules which can best be described by specifying ‘syllable boundary’ as part of the conditioning environment. It is this fact which makes syllabification phonologically relevant. If allophonic rules are to be allowed to refer to syllable boundaries as part of their conditioning environments, one need a principled way of specifying the location of such boundaries. The only cases in English where immediately adjacent syllables have equal grade are those involving weak vowels.},

	abstract = {IntroductionOne of the major concerns of laboratory phonology is that of determining the nature of the transition between discrete phonological structure (conventionally, “phonology”) and its expression in terms of nondiscrete physical or psychoacoustic parameters (conventionally, “phonetics”). A considerable amount of research has been devoted to determining where this transition lies, and to what extent the rule types and representational systems needed to characterize the two levels may differ (see Keating 1985 for an overview). For instance, it is an empirical question to what extent the assignment of phonetic parameters to strings of segments (phonemes, tones, etc.) depends upon increasingly rich representational structures of the sort provided by autosegmental and metrical phonology, or upon real-time realization rules – or indeed upon some combination of the two, as many are coming to believe. We are only beginning to assess the types of evidence that can decide questions of this sort, and a complete and fully adequate theory of the phonetics/phonology interface remains to be worked out. A new synthesis of the methodology of phonology and phonetics, integrating results from the physical, biological and cognitive sciences, is required if we are to make significant progress in this area.The present study examines one question of traditional interest to both phoneticians and phonologists, with roots that go deep into modern linguistic theory. Many linguists have noted the existence of cross-linguistic preferences for certain types of syllable structures and syllable contacts. These have been the subject of descriptive studies and surveys such as that of Greenberg (1978), which have brought to light a number of generalizations suggesting that certain syllable types are less complex or less marked than others across languages.},

Two different techniques are presented to decompose the words into their morphological units. The morphological units are then integrated into an Automatic Speech Recognition System, and those systems are then compared to a word-based approach in terms of accuracy and processing speed. Results show that whereas the morpheme-based approaches perform similarly from an accuracy point of view, they can be significantly faster than the word-based system when applied to a weather-forecast task.},

	abstract = {This paper adopts a novel sub-lexical approach to construct viable continuous speech recognition systems with scalable vocabulary that use the components of words to form the elements of pronunciation dictionaries and recognition lattices. The proposed Concatenative ASR family utilizes combination rules between morphemes (prefixes, stems, and suffixes), along with their theoretical grammatical categories. The constrained structure reduces invalid words by using grammar rules governing agglutination of affixes with stems, while having a large vocabulary space and hence fewer out-of-vocabulary words. In pursuing this approach, the project develops automatic speech recognition (ASR) parameterized models, designs parameter values, constructs and implements ASR systems, and analyzes the characteristics of these systems. The project designs parameter values in the context of Arabic to yield a subset hierarchy of vocabularies of the ASR systems facilitating meaningful analysis. It investigates the characteristics of the ASR systems with respect to vocabulary, recognition lattice, dictionary, and word error rate (WER). In the experiments, the standard Word ASR model has the best characteristics for vocabulary of up to five thousand words and the Concatenative ASR family is most appropriate for vocabulary of up to half a million words. The paper shows that the approach used encompasses fundamentally different processes of word formation and thus is applicable to languages that exhibit concatenative word-formation processes.},

PCMA provides a means for modelling text as a sequence of morphemes in a way that retains compatibility with the linear concatenative model of pronunciation used in conventional decoders. Experiments were performed in English exploiting the 100-million-word British National Corpus as source material. We show that PCMA leads to smaller but more generative pronunciation lexicons, and that it does not weaken the quality of the acoustic decoding measured in terms of recognition lattices. For trigram language models, perplexity figures are poorer for PCMA over words, as might be expected given the reduction in sentence span. However recognition results show small improvements in accuracy under some conditions, particularly when morph lattices are decoded with word-trigram models. We explore the capabilities for PCMA across vocabulary size, language model training size, and post-processing strategy. The best results show a 16\% relative reduction in word error rate.},

	abstract = {We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0\% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a speech recognition system that directly transcribes audio data with text, without requiring an intermediate phonetic representation. The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3\% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9\% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2\% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7\%.},

	doi = {10.1109/ASRU.2017.8268924},
	abstract = {Recently, the acoustic-to-word model based on the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion was shown as a natural end-to-end model directly targeting words as output units. However, this type of word-based CTC model suffers from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue as it can only model limited number of words in the output layer and maps all the remaining words into an OOV output node. Therefore, such word-based CTC model can only recognize the frequent words modeled by the network output nodes. It also cannot easily handle the hot-words which emerge after the model is trained. In this study, we improve the acoustic-to-word model with a hybrid CTC model which can predict both words and characters at the same time. With a shared-hidden-layer structure and modular design, the alignments of words generated from the word-based CTC and the character-based CTC are synchronized. Whenever the acoustic-to-word model emits an OOV token, we back off that OOV segment to the word output generated from the character-based CTC, hence solving the OOV or hot-words issue. Evaluated on a Microsoft Cortana voice assistant task, the proposed model can reduce the errors introduced by the OOV output token in the acoustic-to-word model by 30\%.},

Several support strategies are also proposed to alleviate the unique problems of CIF-based model. With the joint action of these methods, the CIF-based model shows competitive performance.

The paper addresses issues related to system accuracy, training time and practical implementation. The focus is on joint n-gram models which have proven to provide an excellent trade-off between system accuracy and training complexity. The paper argues in favor of simple, productive approaches to G2P, which favor a balance between training time, accuracy and model complexity. The paper also introduces the first instance of using joint sequence RnnLMs directly for G2P conversion, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance via ensemble methods combining RnnLMs and n-gram based models. In addition to detailed descriptions of the approach, minor yet novel implementation solutions, and experimental results, the paper introduces Phonetisaurus, a fully-functional, flexible, open-source, BSD-licensed G2P conversion toolkit, which leverages the OpenFst library.
