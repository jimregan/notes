% 1.1 Include some discussion on what could be a relevant metric for “performance” here? And
% why?
% 1.2 Describe in some detail how you would acquire the three versions of syllables. We want
% to keep the size of the symbol sets manageable for several reasons, one being transparency
% to humans - all or at least most symbols should have a (potential) meaning to humans. You
% can use any technique, including manual annotation, but please motivate the choices in the
% context of the background provided.
% 1.3 What are some of the problems/potential risks you see with your approach?
% 2. Share some of your reasoning.
% 2.1 From your own perspective (the task is not to be “right”, but to reason in a relevant and
% perhaps interesting way), discuss the premise. Is letters/IPA/acoustic phonemes a sensible
% common ground for a mapping between speech and writing, or do (pseudo)syllables have an
% advantage? Is there some other segment that would be a better choice?
% 2.2 Is the intermediate representation - roughly IPA symbols or some kind or some phonetic
% representation at syllable level - needed? What use, if any, can we get from it apart from
% being a necessary evil until we learn how to map speech perfectly to writing?
