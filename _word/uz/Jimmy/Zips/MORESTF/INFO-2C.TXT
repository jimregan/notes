  <B>If you have previously used a version of DOS CIM 
  (prior to version 2.1) and would like to maintain its 
  various support files (filing cabinet, address book, 
  etc.), you will need to convert your DOS CIM directory 
  into a structure that WinCIM will understand.  You can 
  do this by running the <R>MOVECIM.EXE<B> program that is 
  located in the same directory as your WINCIM.EXE file.

  <B>See the file <R>MOVECIM.TXT<B> for instructions.
