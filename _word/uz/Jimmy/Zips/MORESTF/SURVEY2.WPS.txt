HEART DISEASE SURVEY

More than half  of a group of patients screened for heart disease risk factors were found to be overweight, and nearly a third had high blood pressure, it emerged today.


Now researchers are planning a second screening project , to study a larger number of patients, following the disturbing results of the pilot study carried out by the Department of Preventive Medicine in University College, Dublin.


The researchers examined medical reports on forty patients in the Dun Laoghaire area.  GPs screened the patients for such things as excess weight, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.





Nearly 60 per cent of the people examined were overweight, according to the "Irish Medical Times".   A quarter had high cholesterol levels, while 20 to 30 per cent had high blood pressure.

Now, GPs in the wider area of south Co. Dublin are to become involved in a second trial to screen a larger number of patients..
