</ul><p>Trick or treat is an American custom, but it has its origins in earlier
customs: “guising”, which was practiced in Scotland and Ireland; and
“souling”, which was practiced in Britain and Ireland, but is more
usually associated with England.</p>

<p>In “guising”, children wore costumes (or “guises”), and went from door
to door, much like with trick or treat. The main difference was that
children who went guising had to perform something - a joke, a song, or
a poem - to receive a treat.</p>

<p>“Souling” involved people going in groups, offering to pray for the
souls of family members of the people they visited: for this, they would
receive a “soul cake”.</p>

<p>“Trick or treat” is usually just something that people say - these days,
people don’t usually expect to have to play a trick - but in the 1990s,
egging (throwing raw eggs) and TP-ing (throwing an opened roll of toilet
paper, to “decorate” the house) were common “tricks”.</p>
