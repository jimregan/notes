    <h1 class="post-title p-name" itemprop="name headline">Snatch vocabulary</h1><p class="page-description">My Friday morning student (advanced adult) wanted to watch a movie with genuine British accents, and slang. We arrived at "Snatch". I regretted it every time I had to do vocabulary notes. I cringed deeply when I found this; hopefully I'll find it again in the future, and experience the same cringe.</p><p class="post-meta post-meta-title"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-03T00:00:00-05:00" itemprop="datePublished">

</ul><p>Bust a cap in his ass: African-American slang. “Bust a cap” means to
shoot (a <em>cap</em> can be a small explosive used to set off a larger
explosive, especially in mining, so in slang, it’s a bullet); <em>one’s
ass</em> can be used as an emphatic replacement for a pronoun: “my ass is
tired”, “he has to drag his ass to work”. Possibly from <em>work one’s ass
off</em> (to work to the point of fatigue).</p>

<p>Yardie: a Jamaican (“yard” in Jamaican Creole means “home”); more
specifically, a member of a Jamaican gang</p>

<p>Goody gumdrops (or goody goody gumdrops): childish expression of
happiness, usually sarcastic when used by adults.</p>

<p>Pisshead: person who regularly gets drunk. “Piss” can be used to mean
alcohol (“We’re going on the piss” = “we’re going drinking”); <em>-head</em>
can be used to form a noun (usually derogatory) for a person who’s
dedicated to something: a <em>pothead</em> likes to smoke marijuana (“pot”), a
<em>metalhead</em> listens to heavy metal; it can also be added to other
insults to imply stupidity (<em>blockhead</em>, <em>shithead</em>).</p>

<p>Look like curry to a pisshead: curry is an extremely popular post-pub
food in Britain, so this is irresistible food.</p>

<p>Porky pies: rhyming slang for <em>lies</em>. Usually shortened to <em>porkies</em>.</p>
