</ul><p>For Christmas, the school insisted that we get the students to sing
a song, and record it for their parents. So, with older students,
we generally let them pick the song themselves.</p>

<p>I had two all-girl groups, and both chose “Last Christmas” - fine by
me, one set of notes. It also ended up being the song chosen by a
group of mainly boys, because their other teacher foolishly
mentioned that, having spent a Christmas working in retail in
England, she really hated that song. Which I mentioned to them.
Next lesson, she walked in to a serenade of “Last Christmas”,
and immediately came across to the office to ask if I might
know why that had happened.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Very</strong></p>

<p>We most often see “very” as an adverb which intensifies an adjective:
very dark, very wet, etc., but it can also be used as an adjective
meaning “the same” or “identical”: he left that <em>very</em> night.</p>

<p><strong>Once bitten, twice shy</strong></p>

<p>This is a proverb that means that if you’ve been hurt by something once,
you’ll be more careful the next time.</p>

<p>It’s an example of <em>elliptical causation</em>: <em>if</em> once bitten, <em>then</em>
twice shy: that is, the <em>causation</em> (if… then…) is omitted: this
kind of omission is known as an <em>ellipsis</em>, which is also the name given
to the triple dots (…) used to show a piece of a quotation has been
omitted.</p>

<p>Other examples of elliptical causation include “no pain, no gain”,
“waste not, want not”, “nothing ventured, nothing gained”.</p>

<p><strong>Gave</strong>: not that, unlike the standard pronunciation <em>(gejw)</em>, George
Michael pronounces it as <em>gew</em> throughout. This is typical of a number
of accents in England. (He pronounces “save” in a similar manner.)</p>

<p><strong>To catch s.b.’s eye</strong>: to capture someone’s attention.</p>

<p><strong>A shoulder to cry on</strong>: a person who is prepared to listen to someone
else’s problems</p>

<p><strong>Undercover</strong>: in secret; spying.</p>

<p><strong>With a fire in one’s heart</strong>: to be very passionate about something</p>
