Trick or treat is an American custom, but it has its origins in earlier
customs: "guising", which was practiced in Scotland and Ireland; and
"souling", which was practiced in Britain and Ireland, but is more
usually associated with England.

In "guising", children wore costumes (or "guises"), and went from door
to door, much like with trick or treat. The main difference was that
children who went guising had to perform something - a joke, a song, or
a poem - to receive a treat.

"Souling" involved people going in groups, offering to pray for the
souls of family members of the people they visited: for this, they would
receive a "soul cake".

"Trick or treat" is usually just something that people say - these days,
people don't usually expect to have to play a trick - but in the 1990s,
egging (throwing raw eggs) and TP-ing (throwing an opened roll of toilet
paper, to "decorate" the house) were common "tricks".
