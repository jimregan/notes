The first few days of the Easter
Holidays were quite uneventful.
I sat around all day watching
TV. Then on Holy Thursday
I had to pack messages at
Crazy Prices. This was quite
boring too. I had to do it again on
Easter Saturday. At lunch time we
were eating at the Apollo. I had
finished. One of the lads asked my patrol
leader to pass the vinegar. As he was
doing this he knocked the leader's coffee
on top of me. That evening, after
I found out we had no scouts, I
went into Romcos and played my first
ever game of Street Fighter 2. The next
day we went on a parade to mass.

The next Sunday we went
climbing [Galteemore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galtymore). I almost died
of tiredness on the way up and from
the idiots from other units on the way
down. But when we got to the
bottom we stopped for a rest
and we played on a heather-covered hill. Then we went to our buses.

When I got home I found that I had
missed both episodes of "The Simpsons"
and after a while I watched Mr Bean.

Then, after a couple of hours I went to
sleep, dreading school the next
day.
